Amara Singapore,Not up to a high standard,"I’m really unsure how this hotel has so many good reviews. The pros were that the hotel was close to Chinatown, lots of restaurants and eateries, transport, a supermarket. The cons were the air conditioning was super loud, keeping me awake half the night. The room had a stale, musty smell overlaid with a chemical cleaning smell. A couple of the electrical outlets only worked intermittently. I thought it was my adapter but when we moved on to other hotels they worked perfectly fine. One pillow felt crumpled into bits like it’d been around long past any use by date. One of the lifts had tape hastily placed over the lift button. But worst of all, on our last night we had a smoke smell in our room.

Reception upgraded us once more with no question, to a suite. This hallway/ room seemed ok for the first day. The hotel is tired and dirty. The carpets are not cleaned/ hoovered around the perimeter, thick dust and dirt is visible everywhere. Wallpaper is taped up and dirty marks all over.

Amara Singapore,Tired hotel,"Nice staff even though issues at check in with a confusion regarding bag storage. Hotel seems generally very tired, this was probably the place to be 15-20years ago but now needs a full facelift. We were looking forward 1 night stay here on our return to Europe, it was booked specially because of the pool area and us wanting a relaxing time before a near 14h flight. However there are 3 large building sites surrounding the hotel with non stop drilling during daytime making the tranquil idea of pool a no go. Other guests look like they have found their own solution with either earplugs, AirPods, or personal speakers to try and blast out the building noise.

Amara Singapore,Okay hotel,"Stayed here for 3 nights. Reception staff lovely and helpful. Paid for a good room so we could use lounge, thinking cocktails before heading out, no cocktails, just a few spirits, wine and beer. My favourite food was the prawn fritters on the hot buffet. Breakfast was a huge selection of fruit, Asian and European foods. The older guy working on the egg counter was my favourite person in the hotel, so friendly, on the ball and very professional when some Asian men were a bit rude to him. He couldn't do enough for us. It costs nothing to say please or thank you, in fact it could make someone's day better so be nice. Train just around corner from hotel, so easy to use and to get around Singapore.

Amara Singapore,Could have been magnificent but sadly run down,"This is a three star hotel at best. Very old and worn out. Club rooms are a reflection of the lack of investment. Checked into first room, noisy air conditioning, moved another room, less noisy. Unpainted walls where light and control fittings have been swapped out. All tell tale signs. No ambiance and the “club” facilities have been moved to a ground floor reception area. Very little excitement and just felt like someone has laid a picnic buffet out but indoors. Restaurants however have an attraction and for a Saturday night, expected level of customers. I didn’t try the restaurants but they appear highly rated across a number of review sites.

It shows when you look at the TV and the (not even switched on) minibar. The safety box it's not even bolted down. The hotel is clearly understaffed and under serviced. Good luck having anyone pick up the phone after 9pm. I tried front desk and room service, for no avail. The reception is under so much pressure that staff is working mechanically. The breakfast staff is consistently cold and uninterested, excluding one young lady trying to greet people. Do not bother paying extra for ""club"" service.

Amara Singapore,Jewels of Amara Singapore,"This is my 1st time at Amara Singapore. Well, compelled by official reason I was escorted here, rather tear-jerkingly. Never have the luxury of time to plan for this staycation. Much to my astonishment the hotel is paved with hidden 'jewels'. There was this tall and robust Malay attendant who showed me to my room. Though I was then 'ostracised' he accorded me such mannerisms that I felt momentarily normal again and literally forgetting my social stigma. Nightfalls are emotionally distressing in my solitude. That was when I discovered my second jewel. He, Aloysius (Tan?), painstakingly found me a way to preserve items delivered by loved ones to better my predicament. The warmth and empathic assurances were welcoming just like stars brightening up the darkness that chained me.",5 out of 5,August 2021,4.0 of 5 stars,#57 of 372 hotels in Singapore,0.16166666666666668,0.41,58.08333333333333,41.0,16.166666666666668,Location

It was a surprising and worthy candidate. While hotel has been operating for at least twenty years, it is relatively well kept and most importantly very clean. The front desk staff are friendly and made you feel at home, this is their selling point when compared to their more high end competitors who may not be able to provide such homely and personal services. Our room was upgraded to one in the club level, but without the club benefits. Stating this to ensure readers that my review is objective and not because of the club room benefits, since a room in the club level is no different from that in other floors.

He gave us recommendations on dining and hotel facilities and also recommended specific dishes to try. Down side was that service at Element restaurant is too slow, extra rice wasn't served and coffee and dessert order had to be cancelled as we waited too long.

Amara Singapore,Stay elsewhere,"My first time to stay here. And sharing some feedback: THE GOOD: 1. Location- it is beside a mall with great dining options esp if you’re fond of Japanese cuisine. Bar-roque, a highly rated resto is located within the hotel premises. A lot of dining and shopping places are within walking distance. 2. Front Desk staff- generally friendly. THOMAS TAMwas extremely helpful. THE BAD 1. Rooms- though spacious enough, it badly needed renovation. And it seems they have a housekeeping issue; our room was dusty. The hairdryer needs to be replaced/repaired bec the wire is starting to get exposed (see photos) 2. Cafe- staff are not as efficient, except for APPLE(?) who seemed to be the only one attending to the guests with urgency. CHEW HENG at the egg station was quite rude.

Amara Singapore,"Twice the price, half the quality, never staying again","I was excited to stay for the first time at the Amara hotel. Now I’m excited to never stay here again. I like to try different mid-range hotels when I’m in Singapore. Usually I can get a great room for 100-150 USD downtown. I decided to go closer to the 200 USD range for a night and try the Amara hotel. The lobby was fantastic. The check in and staff was fantastic. Check out and getting a taxi booked was great. Everything looked 4-star (Agoda lists it as 5-star). Upon entering the room, the room and bathroom was big. Then my stay made a left turn down mediocre lane. Here are the reasons why the Amara is a 100 USD charging 200 USD a night. 1. The wifi is my biggest complaint.

Amara Singapore,Arrogant hotel with holed bath towel,This hotel is supposed to be a 4-star property but I was shocked when their bath towel has 2 holes. The towel was really old yet still in use. It is really unbecoming to provide guests with towels with holes. This shows that there is no quality control in this hotel. I tried to alert them (not complain) to this matter by emailing them a photo of the torn towel after my stay but they have not bothered to thank me for my alert or reply to my email. I emailed them twice but not a word from them. I have never encountered arrogance of such level from a hotel. Forget about giving any feedback to this hotel.

Amara Singapore,Second time staying,"My recent stay was disappointing. The room was not well maintained. I stayed on the 18th floor. The faucet was leaking, the drainage poor and the water pressure was too low. The pillow case had multiple holes perhaps from being too worn out. Despite supplying 2 pillows, they were too flat, unable to provide any reasonable neck support while sleeping which made it uncomfortable. The leather on the arm rest of the chair had also flaked and faded. I'm not sure I will stay again.

I rarely write reviews but was compelled to do so as I've been very impressed by the friendliness and service level provided by all the staff that I have encountered. Mr. Raymond Foo at the front desk always greets you with a smile (and a joke!) and is always ready to provide assistance like where to eat and what places and activities to explore - even taking the time to write out a map so that I didn't get lost on city the bus. Not only that, he will bluntly tell you if a certain activity is not worth the price, which I greatly appreciated.

Location is amazing, but on top of that, the rooms are not to bad either - not extremely modern, but very clean and comfortable. The pool was partially under renovation while we were there, but otherwise it's a pretty nice oasis in the middle of the skyscraper jungle. Breakfast is amazing, a lot of options and very good food.

The lobby itself feels different from the showcased room photos.

Amara Singapore,An excellent room in a lovely hotel,"After arriving at Changi airport we used the MRT train system to get to the hotel. Use the EW green line from level B2 within the airport, you have to purchase an EZ-Link card for S$10 (including S$5 which is non-refundable) from a vending machine at the station and load it with at least $S10 cash (note you can’t use an international bank card in the machine). This allows travel by MRT trains, local buses, river taxis & Sentosa Express monorail. The EZ-Link cards are also available for purchase and top up from customer service counters at MRT stations and 7-11 stores. To get to the hotel there are 2 stops, first to Tanah Merah (EW4), then connect to Tanjong Pagar (EW15). Use the Tanjong Pagar Road exit, when you come out of the station walk down to Tanjong Pagar Rd, turn left",5 out of 5,September 2023,4.0 of 5 stars,#56 of 372 hotels in Singapore,0.05493827160493828,0.2469135802469136,52.74691358024691,24.69135802469136,5.493827160493828,Value
Amara Singapore,Good experience,"People here are amazing. Raymond, Judy and other staff are really helpful. Lighting in the room is not sufficient. Would have appreciated more space in general. Breakfast is just average for 20 dollars. Not worth the money 420 sgd per day. But if you are getting it for reasonable price it is good.
