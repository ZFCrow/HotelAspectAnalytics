"Crowne Plaza Changi Airport, an IHG Hotel",Very good hotel but beware of how IHG bill your hotel stay,"This is my second stay at Changi CP. My first was in May 2015. Last week I stayed two nights (Nov 5 and 6). This second stay was equally enjoyable except for the billing. I had made my reservation in the US and paid full amount in USD currency as it was a non-refundable Jumpstart Weekend special. Little did I know that my credit card was only charged for the first night (in SGD currency then converted to USD currency plus foreign transaction fee). At the hotel, the front desk manager told me that I will be charged for the 2nd night along with incidentals when I check out. The charge will be in SGD currency. I am writing this review to let unsuspecting hotel guests to beware of the online and phone reservation on IHG website. Their website clearly indicates USD for the",4 out of 5,November 2019,4.5 of 5 stars,#49 of 372 hotels in Singapore,0.1149725274725275,0.34331501831501837,55.74862637362637,34.33150183150184,11.49725274725275,Value
"Crowne Plaza Changi Airport, an IHG Hotel",Very good hotel!,We arrived from Malaysia for a flight the next day to Sydney. As we have been to Singapore many times and seen the attractions we decided to stay at the airport. It was a very good decision! The hotel is an easy walk/train ride from the terminals and check in was pretty quick. The Club Lounge was of a very high standard and the staff there were delightful. Great friendly service and a good selection of food and drinks. Because of the location it was easy to spend the day just exploring Changi Airport which had been voted the World's Best since 2013 for good reason. The room was very quiet and spacious. The bathroom was very impressive and had a great shower. Will stay again when passing through Singapore.,5 out of 5,November 2019,4.5 of 5 stars,#49 of 372 hotels in Singapore,0.5296111111111111,0.6156666666666666,76.48055555555555,61.566666666666656,52.961111111111116,Location

"Crowne Plaza Changi Airport, an IHG Hotel",It all depends,"I loved this hotel on my first visit. This time I had two visits with two less than perfect experiences. First stay I was in an runway view room. This was a large room, nice facilities and nothing heard from the windows but through the door which opened to an open area, well the best way to describe it would be if someone was vacuuming outside your room all night. I slept with noise cancelling headphones. On my second visit I asked to stay in the main building but was instead put in Jewel. Now this should probably have its own entrance as it’s so far away. You go up two levels in the lift, walk a fair way to the official entrance, continue walking a way and then catch a lift to your floor.

"Crowne Plaza Changi Airport, an IHG Hotel","A Little Disappointed, Though Pleasant Stay","We had a local staycation and booked the premier room for a birthday celebration. Had previously read that other patrons were either upgraded or at least had a small cake / greeting card as a gesture from the hotel, but we got neither. The only thing they offered us was a late checkout at 2pm (normal checkout time is 12pm). We were a little disappointed, and thought that they would at least offer something for a special occasion (even a greeting card would be nice). This was rather surprising given that we stayed over on a Sunday (which shouldn't be that busy compared to a Saturday). That said, the 36 sqm room was clean and spacious for two; had some issues with the flush in the bathroom, but it's not much of a bother once you get the hang of it.

"Crowne Plaza Changi Airport, an IHG Hotel",The perfect stop over,"If you have to stop over this is the perfect hotel which is walking distance with your luggage from the terminal. The only confusing bit is that reception is on the ground level but you enter on a higher level. After a long flight it is great to have access to luxury, space and comfort. Noise levels were great and you could barely hear the planes. We decided to eat in the hotel which tries to push the buffet, which I guess is easier, but as we weren't that hungry we just wanted to order something small, and so service was very slow. Breakfast the next morning had a good choice and service was faster. It certainly feels so good to see a pool when you are so close to the airport.

After a 3-month journey through Singapore and Australia, the Mrs. and I were heading back home and had an overnight layover in Singapore. After considering some of the other options, we chose the Crowne Plaza Changi Airport since it had direct terminal access and appeared to be the nicest of the selection with that feature.

From the initial email sent, staff from Crowne Plaza were quick in their response. I was blown away by how prompt they responded via calls and emails.

"Crowne Plaza Changi Airport, an IHG Hotel",DISAPPOINTING,Had a 12 hour layover at Changi and booked staying at this hotel. We were very confused by the location and learned we had to go through Immigration since it actually outside the gate area. I wish there had been clearer instructions on their web site how to access the property. Upon arrival we were grilled about when we would be leaving the room. We knew approximately when but not the exact time. We finally gave them a later time that we when we actually left. The lobby and all rooms have outside entry and when we arrived in our room on the 9th floor the temperature was 29 inside. The air conditioning was defective and it struggled to cool the room to about 27 when we left the next morning. We were just too tired to try to deal with changing to a different room,1 out of 5,October 2022,4.5 of 5 stars,#49 of 372 hotels in Singapore,-0.05538461538461539,0.37,47.23076923076923,37.0,5.538461538461539,Location

"Crowne Plaza Changi Airport, an IHG Hotel",Easily one of the best airport hotels in the world,"I've had a decent share of spending nights in an airport hotel while on work-related travel. And while the latter is on a hiatus at the moment, I do miss the part which allows me to explore new hotels. So, while on leave, I decided to embark on a 4-night staycation, with each night spent in a different local hotel. The Crowne Plaza Changi Airport was my first stop, and I was eager to see why it's been consistently voted as one of the best, if not the best, airport hotel in the world. Arriving at the hotel in the mid-afternoon, the lobby was fairly quiet. As required of local regulations, the hotel staff were diligent in ensuring that movement registration and temperature checks were performed for all guests.

"Crowne Plaza Changi Airport, an IHG Hotel",Good for an airport hotel,This was a natural choice for a 22hr stopover. Nice decorated new room in the jewel wing but the dark brown color makes the room look small and not as new as its true age. Bed was very comfortable but bad shower. Weak water pressure rendered the rain shower useless. Even the handheld shower was a pain due to the bad pressure which caused the water temperature to oscillate between too hot and too cold nonstop. Wonder if a lower floor room would be better. We were on 7/F.
