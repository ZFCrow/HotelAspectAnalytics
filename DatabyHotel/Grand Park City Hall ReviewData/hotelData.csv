Capella Singapore,Annual Birthday Stay for my friend,"Did a birthday celebration for my friend again in Capella, they really never fail to impress. There were little hiccups this round, but the service recovery we receive made the rest of our stay as exquisite as before by Mr Roman Angulo.

Capella Singapore,One of my favorite hotels In Singapore.,"My Singapore’s favorite hotel! First time returning to Capella after the four years’ Covid drama. This time I made a booking mistake, instead of June I picked “May”in my original booking. Of course my May booking became a “no-show” to the hotel. At first I thought it was the website error but I guessed it was my own mistake. Anyway when the front desk couldn’t find our booking when we arrived , they handled the situation professionally and comforted us in a calmly manner. With a cup of cool drink we were assured we would be taken care of. We were directed to the library to wait for the next available Villa. Everyone was so welcoming and friendly.

Capella Singapore,A class above the best,"Good luxury hotels in Singapore are plentiful, great ones even. But there is one that has continually captivated us (and our wallets) year after year – The Capella. It is not difficult to see why.

Rooms-wise, they are very likely the biggest at every category and also amongst the most beautifully designed. On a guest-size to property-size ratio, it is certainly feels like the biggest hotel in the country (just take a look at the amount of real estate the hotel occupies on Sentosa island, and you’ll get a sense of how privileged the guests and residents are).

Bathrooms are bright and well appointed with greenery view. This room has an extended outdoor area so you can walk around abit more which was great with my family. One thing is that I find the duvet way too thick and you really have to turn up the AC at night, and there is no choice of pillows as I find them too high.

Capella Singapore,Disappointing 'sea view' room,"Second-time stay at Capella with our dog. Booked a sea view king, but was very disappointed to discover that the room — located at the tail end of the building — was essentially overlooking Sentosa island itself. You get, at best, 30% of the promised sea view — the rest of your vista comprises of Sentosa island, including the RWS buildings in the distance. The balcony had no soft furnishings and only came with a hard stone 'bench' (which was not very comfortable at all) — but I suppose there wasn't much of a view to luxuriate in.

Arrived at 12pm I was told the official check in timing is 3pm.

We also enjoyed the boba tea workshop at Bob's bar with Nurul and Kennis (bubble tea served at Capella, who would have thought!). We were able to enjoy the pool and was warmly served by Sam.

Capella Singapore,Leaves much to be desired,"[Warning: Long review] TLDR: The Capella team did do a few unexpected things to delight customers, but there were far too many things that we felt were basic expectations that were simply unmet. My husband and I have travelled a good amount (pre-covid), at least enough to know how to tamper our expectations. We are also not ones to be overly critical or intentionally badmouth hospitality establishments, because we can appreciate how difficult it is to please customers and run a business of this scale. In fact, we hardly write reviews! But our stay at Capella compelled us to pen these thoughts simply because there were too many things left to be desired.

For our wedding, although there were plenty hiccups at the initial stages, but during the wedding reception itself, service from Cassia team (Bryan and team) was prompt and attentive, all our guests praised the food and service! The rest of the 3 nights we spent after the wedding was one of the best staycation we had for the past 2 years ever since the lockdown! Spacious room with great jacuzzi (we stayed in the constellation garden room - upgraded with Black discovery membership), beautiful pools (it’s like we are in bali!) and wonderfully green property with plenty of trees and plants everywhere we go.

Capella Singapore,A lovely family staycation at Capella,"I booked a staycation for 2 days, 1 night on Aug 14th to celebrate both my hubby and son's birthday. I was truly impressed with the level of service. The Culturist, Cheryl Kwan went above and beyond her duties to entertain both my kids. There was a bath bomb making class, which my son wanted to attend however was unable too as the class was already full. Cheryl took the effort to deliver bath bombs and cookies to my room just to cheer up my boy. She naturally has the X factor to work with kiddos. Another lovely soul whom I want to compliment is Mr.Saravana Kumar who was mending the pool. He made my son's day by suprising him with a cake at the poolside. Not only that.. he kept monitoring all the kiddos whether everyone was safe and kept entertaining the kids.

That said! Overall 5/5 because the overall service was impeccable. Highlights were Anil from the pool who offered great service and care.

Capella Singapore,Wonderful honeymoon staycation,"We had a most enjoyable staycation honeymoon at Capella Singapore and highly recommend the hotel. We chose Capella to ""getaway to nature"" as it offers a one-of-its-kind location in Singapore overlooking both lush green rainforests and beautiful blue sea. Although this is the most expensive hotel we ever stayed in, we feel that Capella offers excellent value for any special occasions: 1.

Capella Singapore,Singapore Farewell Staycation,"I’m not one to write reviews. I was even less prone to the idea of a “staycation”. However, when it was time for my husband and I to leave Singapore after living there for almost 4 years we thought - what a better goodbye than a weekend at the renowned Capella. I was skeptical at first because I never bought into the idea of a staycation. That didn’t last long, though. From the moment we stepped out of our car we felt that we had been transported to a high end paradise. We were greeted like royalty, then walked to our beautiful suite with a stunning view of the pool and tree tops (first row seats to birdwatching) and the sea at the background. Our room was huge, the bed humongous and super comfy! The bathroom was also big and super stylish.

Is it the high standard of service, or the high quality of fare? Is it the thoughtfulness and high attention to details of the Capella staff? Is it the luxurious and classy experience which never failed to revive our weary souls? I believe it is all of these reasons.

It's indeed like a home away from home, the villa (no.8) other than a luxurious set up, it is also a well thought out, well featured and practical design. Other than the room, the landscape is so well done that one feel that this is situated at somewhere (Bali?) but in Singapore. So it is so worth my paid value to stay there instead of having to fly to some foreign country. Thus, the costs and time for a local Sigaporean is every bit worthwhile to spend at Capella for such 'rejuvenating' vacation. Thank you Mei Ping, Fernando and team for such a wonderful experience.

Capella Singapore,Shockingly poor customer service,"A massive disappointment - I booked the Capella for the whole family (5 of us) to celebrate my wife’s 50th birthday (20/21 March). If you’re looking for excellent customer service then go to Raffles where we celebrated my birthday last year in great style and with perfect service. At Capella (which was even more expensive), we received a cold welcome, a disaster at breakfast the following day (which wasted two hours of our morning) and the hotel double blocked my credit card, making it go over my limit and causing other transactions to be cancelled. Multiple requests for a senior manager to call me afterwards yielded zero response.

Capella Singapore,Capella- the only hotel for me in Singapore,"We booked a one bedroom villa for 3 nights. Instead of detailing the hardware, i’d document my typical day at Capella. But first, let me say that breakfast at the Knolls was good. Damage was $48++. The ala-carte buffet concept was a good idea as the quality was preserved. The scrambled eggs and avocado toast were awesome and the best i’ve had in a hotel. However, the spread is not great so i only did brekkie once.

Capella Singapore,A nice weekend staycation!!,"I stayed at the Capella on Sentosa Island for 2 nights in November with my partner. We stayed in a Villa with a private pool. We both absolutely loved the Capella. It is modern, lux and friendly. The villa had the most amazing tech details… everything controlled by buttons on a control panel by the bed. Separate aircon units in every room (bathroom/bed/living), 2 plasma TV’s (bed/living). All blinds were controlled by the panel too.. my partner who is a bit of a tech freak was over the moon. There was also a free mini bar and a Nespresso machine in the villa.. all the little details that makes it so much more luxurious. Having a wonderful terrace and a private plunge pool means it is difficult to drag yourself away from the privacy of your villa!

There were a few minor issues which given the expectations (and price) set by the Capella might need to be addressed. There were a few maintenance issues in the villa (top of the outdoor table melted by cigarettes, we need to clean out the pool ourselves when we arrived).

Grand Park City Hall,"Great location, great for families","The Grand Park City Hall was really wonderful! My wife had a conference nearby and we brought the whole family. We stayed in a Family Room Suite which consisted of two adjacent rooms: one just right for an adult couple and one perfectly suited for two young kids, complete with a chalkboard wall and a futon in a colorful tent as well as kids’ shampoo and bubble bath. The included breakfast buffet had quite the variety of western and southeast Asian options. The location is great, just a short walk to the very centrally located City Hall MRT station and maybe a dozen bus lines. You can also walk to many of the tourist greatest hits, particularly the national gallery which is two blocks away.

The front desk staff was often too busy (the ratio of front desk staff to guests often felt insufficient) and did not seem to have the authority to approve of simple requests like an upgrade for an Expedia Platinum member.

Grand Park City Hall,Amazing Experience in the Crystal Club,This is quite a gem of a hotel in downtown Singapore. It's perfectly connected to everything you might want to do. We decided to stay in their Crystal Club rooms and we are so glad we did because the service and attention to detail was flawless. You start your stay by checking in on the 9th floor and while your being checked in you can enjoy a nice espresso coffee or soft drink in the Crystal Lounge. Our room was well appointed and very clean on the 10th floor with daily housekeeping service and fancy soaps and extras. Breakfast was available on the 3rd or the 9th floors but we opted for breakfast on the 9th in the Crystal Lounge as it was very quiet with a great city view.

Loved the Crystal Lounge on 9th floor where I can have breakfast in peace rather than the main restaurant on 3rd floor. Also evening snacks n drink in Lounge worked out perfect for me as I like to eat lightly. Kripa is a wonderful hostess at the Lounge with personalised attention and care. I did change my upgraded room to a normal deluxe room for better view and lighter feel. I could not take the sombre grey of upgraded room. The one pain though in all the rooms is the lighting control panel on the wall. To turn on or off any lights you have to get up from bed and use the clunky panel! I longed for a simple master switch next to bed.

Grand Park City Hall,Absolutely amazing experience!,"If you are considering this hotel, I 100% recommend! I have stayed in Singapore a few times, and just got back from 6 nights. It was an amazing trip! I would highly recommend upgrading to one of the Crystal club rooms or higher so you get the daily breakfast, daily refreshments, high tea, and evening cocktails each day. The customer service was brilliant, and nothing was too much for them. Gladys was who I first dealt with in the Crystal Club lounge, and she was amazing! Also Mayshell who served throughout the day - excellent service. In the evenings I usually got served by Kripa and Nani - both very lovely.

Our room was 4 doors from the Club lounge, which made it extremely handy! We must commend Mayshell in particular for her lovely personality in the evenings, and willingness to help.

Bathroom layout poor - you have to squeeze past the toilet to get to the shower. Shower leaked. No desk. I had to find a UK-style plug adapter (no universal). Lighting/air con remote very awkward. Why not a standard modern key operated remote ? Pool tiny, more like a pond. Photos are deceptive. Hotel service phone didn’t work. Had to go to 7-Eleven to get ice cubes !

Too many fancy ideas but a lack of thought for everyday things like drawers for cloths (shirts, underwear etc), no desk for a little work and silly light/heating controls - normal switches are so much easier and quicker, no bath robes, no luggage racks ( needed to ask for robes & racks). Hotel used by cruise guests before & after their trips so the main entrance looks like the left luggage office of a railway station and not a 5 star establishment. Room was on the small side (even without drawer units). Pool is small with little shade and appears that pre booking is required (why??? It's 5 star!!).

Grand Park City Hall,Worst Breakfast Experience in the Far East,We stayed here on the last leg of a tour that included Bangkok and Koh Samui. For some reason we were diverted to the ninth floor Crystal Lounge for breakfast where we had to queue in a corridor for 35 minutes. When we eventually got in the choice of breakfast items iwas worst than a Premier Inn with no options of eggs except boiled and the only cereals on offer being cornflakes. When we sat down we had to ask for the table to be cleaned. No-one offered us a hot drink and when we did get some attention they forgot to bring my coffee. Extremely disappointed.

Grand Park City Hall,Tech Failed Staycation,"As a hotel that promotes the seamless check-in and use of technology and their app for guests' stay, this really was not the case. The app didn't allow us to check-in even 24 hours before our stay.

Grand Park City Hall,Terrible service,"Stayed here from 18/03 to 20/03 as a family. I would say the room is pretty nice, partly due to the hotel did some renovations recently. Only that the water pressure for the shower is too weak and basin drainage is very slow. Other than that, I've no complains for the room. Their customer service is very very poor. Just imagine, I requested for a single blanket from 8pm. Till 10pm I've yet to receive it. Been calling, even went down to their reception to request for a blanket and all they say is that they will get their runner to deliver it asap. I understand that the hotel may be fully book since it's a school holiday period and occupancy may be full. So the hotel management should do what it takes to cope with the overwhelming orders and request from their in house guest.",1 out of 5,March 2021,5.0 of 5 stars,#37 of 372 hotels in Singapore,-0.005165343915343919,0.6440145502645502,49.741732804232804,64.40145502645503,0.5165343915343918,Services

Standard procedure for covid measures were dealt efficiently. It took approx 15 mins for us to be issued with our rooms. •Room was splendid, clean and neat. The interior was tastefully modern. Bed was super comfy, and the pillow was just perfect. The only downside was there's no bidet in the toilet. •Although breakfast was simple with limited varieties to choose from, the customer service of staffs especially the aunties serving us made up for it.

Grand Park City Hall,Do not book the club rooms,"Was very disappointed to find that the club lounge was closed. Hotel shifted the 'lounge' to a small exposed area on level 3 that basically offers u nothing. The only major difference between the usual rooms and 'club rooms' is just an afternoon tea or cocktail set and thats it, which u r actually paying for in the price difference. With the difference u can easily have a good meal or drinks in a much nicer setting elsewhere. The hotel management needs to understand that the club rooms is really more of an experience. The best service that we have received is so often from the staff at the club lounges. We booked club rooms for quiet moments where we can enjoy some drinks and also interact with the lounge staff.

Grand Park City Hall,The best place for a weekend staycation!,"Booked the Park Suite with a small group of friends for a birthday celebration. When we first stepped into the hotel, we were greeted by an amazing front desk who made sure that we had all we needed to have a comfortable stay (first impression well done!) We also had club access to all day beverages and evening cocktails. Our server, James, even went above and beyond and made a plate of goodies for our birthday girl! That really made us feel special :) Our Park Suite came with a living room area, bedroom area, steamer, bathtub, and even an outdoor jacuzzi! To give us more of a birthday vibe, the hotel staff even prepared balloons and a small cake for us. Talking about feeling special again!! The hotel staff were all very friendly and helpful.

Grand Park City Hall,Holiday and F1 Trip,"When we first arrived at the hotel we were greeted by Lornie and Iwan at the foyer who were super welcoming and helpful. Throughout the week we would see Lornie, Iwan and the other foyer guys who were all very helpful with directions or info on getting about. We had a Premier King Room for a week, the room is large enough when staying for more than a weekend. Plenty of room to store luggage etc. A lot of people on TA moan about the room controls (lights & aircon) being all together on a screen and not physical switches but you get used to it quick enough and you can use your phone also and for the room key/lift but they do give you physical room keys too. We found there to be plenty of options for breakfast and really enjoyed the Asian dishes.

Grand Park City Hall,Great location for F1 and sightseeing,"The hotel was beautifully decorated and the staff super attentive. The rooms could do with a bit more space to hang things (hooks, coat hangers etc) but that is literally all that was wrong. It’s in a great inner city location and was a fantastic spot for zone 4 for the F1. Shout out to Joseph who really looked after me and my friends, particularly looking out for me when I was on my own as a single lady… checking that I was ok.

Grand Park City Hall,Pleasant staff and comfortable stay,"Stayed at this wonderful and clean hotel for about 3 days with my husband. It was a pity that we had to leave the night earlier, would have been more than glad to have stayed longer. Special thanks to the nice lady Miss Hema at reception for warmly receiving us and even helping us sort out our vehicle pick up issue. We truly appreciate for checking in on us every time we required help. Breakfast area was most of the time crowded but all staff at the restaurant were polite when serving us. Room was spacious and comfortable during our stay.

Grand Park City Hall,Excellent Hotel In a Great Location,"This Hotel was recommended by friends and did not disappoint. On nearly all aspects the hotel was excellent. We had a Crystal Club room on the 9th Floor. The Club is open all day for food and refreshment. The Crystal Club team were professional, courteous and friendly. Gladys, Clips and Nani were outstanding team members. We found the In-Room Touch panel concept annoying. It was difficult to use. No one informed us that an app was available to manage the lighting. A light switch would have been a better option! The location is fabulous and within walking distance to many attractions, MRT and Grand Prix circuit. The Conceige team were always smiling and helpful. Would we stay here again?
