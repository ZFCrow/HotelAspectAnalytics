Grand Hyatt Singapore,Pleasantly Pleasant Staycation!,"We stayed at Grand Hyatt Singapore from 29 November to 1 December 2020. This was the first staycation during COVID-19 times, 10 months after our Chinese New Year Staycation in January 2020. Needless to say, we were very excited about this staycation at Grand Hyatt and were looking forward to it. Check-in was smooth, although the hotel was quite full during that period. Our room was on level 8. And we were pleasantly surprised that it included a living room too! We were able to move more freely in this extra space, choosing to watch the TV shows either in the bedroom or in the living room. The bathroom was great. Standing shower was nice, and the bathtub was wonderful. Quite a deep bathtub as compared to other hotels we have stayed. The location was a winning factor,",5 out of 5,November 2020,5.0 of 5 stars,#74 of 373 hotels in Singapore,0.3211931818181818,0.6506439393939394,66.0596590909091,65.06439393939394,32.11931818181818,Services

Shout-out to the accomodating, friendly & helpful Front Office Team namely Azizah, Mai, Jennifer, Tiara & Hartini. Keep up the top notch service ladies! To add, the rooms were superb! However, maybe they can do something to the product as in the bed (mattress & pillow) are kinda hard and not comfortable at all, which resulted to bodyaches.

On 14 May Singapore government announced tightened measures for Covid control to prohibit dining in public starting 16 May. Fortunately there is ""Grandfather Allowance"" for wedding only to proceed on that day but every guest needs to be tested. Grand Hyatt is excellent in helping the frustrated couple to find the resources needed and generously allows space and rooms for them to cope with the requirements. Under these circumstances, the wedding is a simple one with limited guests and my daughter has no bridesmaid to help. We are so thankful to a lady staff who attended to her all the time and helped in every detail. The bride's changing room was also tidied up timely during the whole event.

Grand Hyatt Singapore,What an amazing room.,"beautiful hotel with beautiful rooms. my room didnt have a great view (it was very closely facing another building), but as we stayed in with the curtains drawn most the time and our gaze fixated on the giant TV which we hooked to our laptop (bring a HDMI cable if you'd like), it was not a problem for us. HUGE room with a living and working space which helped greatly as I worked from the office for a bit, and it felt so wonderful to have such a big space. The bathrooms were top notch, clean and roomy. It was nice to live in bathrobes for 2 days before returning back to our daily lives. The hotel offered a $100 extension to check in early which we obviously gladly took. p/s. scan the QR code on the table to look at the compendium and see the types of pillows that are available.",5 out of 5,May 2021,5.0 of 5 stars,#74 of 373 hotels in Singapore,0.4001515151515152,0.6100000000000001,70.00757575757575,61.00000000000001,40.01515151515152,General

Grand Hyatt Singapore,Bad stay at the Grand Hyatt,"Really horrible. I had 3 rooms booked for my family staycation. Upon check in we had to swap 1 room immediately due to lights not in working condition and no bath tub. Later in the evening around 6pm, my second room had to be swapped as the lights were turning off and on by themselves and it was a freak show. By the next morning, I realised that I was sweating in my sleep as the aircon in my sleeping area was totally not working at all, and there was a loud machinery sound that affected my sleep. I had the worse sleep ever in a 5 star hotel and went home to take a nap. Usually do not have any issues with my experience in SG local staycay, but this experience with Hyatt really opened my eyes.

I strongly disagreed after spending 3 days there. Definitely a bigger room than most hotels. There was a living/work area. Probably good for business travelers, then again, not enough outlets. Extremely dark and uninviting bathroom. I refused to use the bathtub. Bathroom came with one sink. Most hotels I went had duo sinks. Overall, the room was dated and in desperate need of a renovation.

Grand Hyatt Singapore,Great modern room,"Stayed in deluxe room. The living room area, bedroom & toilet is awesome. I borrowed HDMI usb from the hotel to watch netflix/youtube from my device. The housekeeping guy (room service) arrived my room promptly when I requested for toiletories. I bought magherita pizza from the hotel and wished that layer of cheese is thicker and maybe add other kind of cheese too (burrata cheese & blue cheese). I like the thin crust dough. Bath tub is big. The rain shower is the best part, the pressure is great, feels just like waterfall! The shower head is great too! 1 thing which I dislike the most is the mattress. Mattress is thin, not posh and not luxury. Mattress is hard and I can feel the spring.

First off, the location is smack in the middle of the famed Orchard Road. It is indeed a shopper's paradise. Even thought the shops are supposed to be closed for CNY, there were still plenty open to keep us busy. On the positive side, the traffic on Orchard Road was unusually light on those two days.

Grand Hyatt Singapore,Very disappointing,"(I wrote this review in another web property) At one point this was likely a great property that provided a great hotel experience. On this stay it was unfortunately not. It wasn‚Äôt the noise from construction and repair activity (which I had expected and the fact that my room was on a high enough floor that the noise was not audible), but the general dilapidated nature of the room fixtures (bathroom, etc) that made it a relatively unpleasant (for the money spent) experience. In addition the lobby without seating (ie couches etc) made it look like a deserted hotel. This hotel, being in such a nice location, has a lot of potential. I highly recommend an ‚Äúactive‚Äù lobby with music, preferably a lobby bar, sufficient seating area etc. As a very frequent visitor to Singapore I had",3 out of 5,August 2022,5.0 of 5 stars,#74 of 373 hotels in Singapore,0.12291666666666667,0.6574999999999999,56.14583333333334,65.74999999999999,12.291666666666668,Value

I like the nice big rooms. I like how the price point adjusted for its age and closure of faculties. But it definiteley needs a much welcome overhaul and renovation. I also wonder if they will redesign the actual layout to be more 'grand'. Hoping that when I return in January the rooms remain spacious but modernized. Hopefully the back tower no longer feels like an old office block! Pros - checkin staff is excellent.
