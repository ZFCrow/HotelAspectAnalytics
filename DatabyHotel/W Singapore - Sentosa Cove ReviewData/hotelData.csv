W Singapore - Sentosa Cove,Could be Better,"I've been travelling a lot more recently and the Marriott Group is my go to. I have stayed at the W Singapore twice. Once in October 2021 and again in May 2022. My family and I were very well taken care by Robert, Vijay, Nishita, Wai Meng and the General Manager, Nick for our first stay. When we stayed again my husband contacted Vijay to better plan our stay and we were greeted by the lovely Nishita who pampered my little ones with macarons and popcorn. Wai Meng from the breakfast cafe was amazing and remembered us! This time our stay was a let down. We were disappointed to find out that the staff who usually takes care of us were gone. Even so we expected service to be just as top notch as our last two stays.

This is in Sentosa so a little bit out of the way of the main city, but easy enough to get about, buses to resorts world and in the city run regularly.

The rooms were nice, very comfortable with good service round the hotel. Some things weren't ideal, the chair beds round the pool weren't the most comfortable, the service round the pool wasn't particularly attentive.

The Woo bar itself is lovely and some tables look over the pool area. On certain nights they do different themed all you can drink for 3 hours with nibbles.

We had a night swim at the pool as it was 24 hour in operation . The pool was warm at night. It was really nice swimming at night.

W Singapore - Sentosa Cove,Welcoming stay,W Sentosa is a gorgeous property in a pretty if somewhat remote location. As SPG Platinum was upgraded to an Away Room - even though I had put in a suite award request and various suites were available on both the one night stayed and the previous and next nights. The Away room does give you the Away from home feeling and is very well appointed with a plunge pool and gorgeous bed and bath. Additional furniture is more form over function; the daybed outside was nearly touching the floor when one sits in it together and the cute red chair isn’t comfortable to sit in for longer than 15 minutes because of its texture. Also the outside area feels a little claustrophobic with your terrace and plunge pool surrounded by walls on all sides.

Most hotels provide only one designated space and by then it feels a bit cramped. Since it was only a 2 days weekend stay I didn’t feel like unpacking.

During my fifth stay, we had a lovely brunch - Natalie was our waitress - and she was so nice (as was the food!).

The service was top-notch, though the food could have been better - eg. stingray (one of my favorite foods) was overcooked and dry. It is quite out of the way so you would only stay here if you were planning a few days to chill and visit Sentosa attractions.

W Singapore - Sentosa Cove,Wrong brand for location and clientele,"I understand the brand concept, its a hip, place for beautiful people where there are constant pool parties, smothered in cool luxury, think an LMFAO video, without the humor. Its situated in Sentosa Cove, close to multi million dollar homes, and a marina for the crazy rich asians. Staffed by young people who think they have a cool job, cos they are dressed in black. The hardware is ok, with decent 40 sq meter rooms, which are nicely designed with sliding closet and bathroom doors to maximize space. Then you have this crappy mood lighting, called ""hello"" (amber), ""escape"" (fuchsia), ""runway "" (pink) and flirt (purple).

It was hard trying to just turn off the lights at bed time, without accidentally turning on one of the different mood lighting options.

W Singapore - Sentosa Cove,"Relaxing, lazy days.","Enjoyed the king away rooms, cosy and well kept with just the right amount of space for unwinding and getting a few days of rest on sentosa. The room pools were a good size for 2 and quite hidden unless you were looking from above. Check in was speedy and relatively fuss free. We had lunch at the restaurant and the service was excellent. The portions of chicken rice were very large and the beer was fresh. Woo bar afterwards was excellent, the cocktails were interesting and the staff were knowledgeable. Had room service twice and everything we ordered was excellent - spaghetti bolognese, laksa and wonton noodles.

Pool area was clean and tidy with plenty of waiting staff to provide drinks and food if required. The Hotel is about 20 mins or so from downtown Singapore in a taxi and costs a variation of 15-20 SGD dependant on drop off area.

W Singapore - Sentosa Cove,Loved it. Except for the late check out...,"Really liked this place. W’s are an acquired taste - the whole edgy party hotel thing can get a bit annoying. Here it was toned down some what we thought. There’s still the quirky design stuff and ‘art’ littered all over. It’s all about the unique touches and these are what make it. Check in was smooth, we had an upgrade (Gold+). They said they’d contact us when the room was ready - they never did, so we returned anyway after 3pm. That slight hiccup aside - it was very effortless and the luggage was already in the room.

W Singapore - Sentosa Cove,Fabulous hotel for a lazy weekend,"We stayed for 3 nights over the Easter long weekend. The hotel was busy but unhurried. Located on a rather far corner of Sentosa, the connections into town were surprisingly convenient. We ordered a Grab car from the lobby, which arrived within 3 minutes on a rainy afternoon. I booked a Wonderful Room, which was their most ‘basic’ offering , but it was extremely spacious, light and airy. I have always been a fan of the W Brand, and it certainly exceeded my expectations. Kids were offered free ice cream! The pool was great, with the water slide an added bonus. Some rooms face the pool, which offers a nice view. We had a most enjoyable breakfast buffet in this hotel. We particularly loved the local Southeast Asian breakfast offerings which we almost never see at home.

Instead it was a late check-in by the hotel - even when an early check in was requested, room service (some ice) came after 45 minutes and 3 calls - each call they had no idea of the order of frozen water.

W Singapore - Sentosa Cove,Possibly the best hotel service ever!,"I often travel to SE Asia on business and wanted to take the family for a change. We booked through a well known website which included flights and hotel. We took a gamble on W Sentosa. Most of my friends and contacts advised we aimed at less “vibrant” locations as it can get a bit loud! Well, we like a bit of fun and couldn’t have been happier with our choice. From arriving at the hotel we could tell service was going to be a bit special. The room was fantastic! Mood lighting, super beds and TV with a proper Bose system! We asked for an HDMI cable (when they say “anything anytime” they mean it) and we were able to play music and watch our favourite movies (our kids are now 11 and 7).

Rooms of the hotel has unique style of deco which only can be afforded by W hotels as they have unique lifestyle theme to follow.

She was the one that assisted my enquiries and demands before I was due for check in yesterday. She provided me with many options on decorating the room and bouquet brochure few weeks before the date of check-in. And to ensure that everything went smoothly, she went all out to ensure that the room was prepared before the standard check in timing at 3pm. Because I wanted to give my fiancee an early surprise hence I request if its possible to check-in earlier and PeiZhen did her utmost to accommodate my demands.

W Singapore - Sentosa Cove,Dissatisfied with value for money,"Yes was a nice hotel and good customer service but any extras very overpriced. Absolutely no alcohol in the cocktails by the pool, I actually couldn’t believe they could be so blatant as to serve the cocktails that u were lucky if they had 1/8 a nip of alcohol in, absolute ripoff. Also ate at the resort restaurant and again no alcohol in the cocktails and wine and bubbles are so overpriced you wouldn’t bother. Also understand that the $450 that gets deducted as a placeholder from your credit card when you check in is actually charged to your credit card. When I asked front office they advised it was a miscommunication and it will be refunded in 2 weeks, a completely different story to when I checked in.

Customer service at this hotel is slow and unimpressive. 1) Their spa discount stipulations for Marriot Ambassadors are unclear and their staff provide conflicting info even. in writing. 2) We had dinner at the steak house and my mom literally fell asleep waiting for the food to be served- it took Them more than 3.5 hours to complete our dinner service- this wasn't a 20 course meal. Very slow and nothing to write home about. 3) It took more than an hour for me to check out because of disputes with charges. My elderly parents had to wait in the lobby for an hour while we settled the spa dispute which I had in writing- I was horrified by how they treated a Marriott Ambassador.

To our pleasant surprize, our food came individually to us still hot! Even the plates were pretty warm to the touch. Such a welcome change and it was noticed immediately and appreciated.

There are some excellent happy hour deals too! 2. Check-in was very efficient; the young-ish staff did it with minimal hassle. The only letdown (and I stress, an insignificant one), was that the check-in staff did not notify me that I had breakfast included in my package, and where breakfast would be served. 3.

Room was definitely clean as always and staff were absolutely amazing! The plunge pool was amazing and we spent a full day in the hotel itself just lazing in the room and by the pool.

W Singapore - Sentosa Cove,Weekend Staycation,My daughter booked a room for us on my sixty year birthday . That was six year ago. This time we stayed as platinum elite guests. The service was great plus we get unlimited drinks during happy hours at the bar. The hotel is still immaculate and modern. We were not expecting full occupancy because of Covid-19 but it was school holiday and Singaporean flocked to Sentosa for staycation. The queue for breakfast was incredibly Long. Over at the Sangrila it was like a ghost town according to my son. There are many attractions in Sentosa so staying at W hotel makes sense. We visited universal studio and adventure Cove and had a very good time even though we are a rather old couple but mobile.

W Singapore - Sentosa Cove,Great hotel but terrible breakfast management,This is our third time at the hotel - always liked it here for our staycations and that’s why we are back again. But I have to stay that this time the breakfast queue management was extremely bad. The hotel clearly knows it’s operating at maximum capacity but made no effort whatsoever to expand their breakfast capacity and was somehow miraculously hoping for self regulation. Come on guys - firstly to manage covid 19 there should have been extra measures like maybe opening up another area (eg the bar upstairs or the empty ballroom) instead of everyone queueing along a crowded corridor. Or getting hotel guests to pick a staggered breakfast time. At the moment I’ve been queueing for 30 min. Guests who just joined the queue - good luck because the queue has stretched to the main,1 out of 5,March 2020,5.0 of 5 stars,#12 of 16 hotels in Sentosa Island,0.0878787878787878,0.3378787878787879,54.39393939393939,33.7878787878788,8.787878787878787,Services

Access to the main pool area was also limited to 2 hours per group per day to avoid overcrowding given the pandemic, and that contributed to the fact that the spa was fully booked for all 3 days of our stay so we missed out there as well.

The W just looks like an overpriced 3-star hotel but with poor service and most disappointingly the hotel did not inform us at any time that there would be a tonne of restrictions during our stay until we were physically checking in at the front desk - which completely ruined the 'staycation'. Essentially guests are only allowed to use the pool for 2 hours a day, which you had to make a reservation in advance + specific time bands for breakfast. The quality of the food and service was a let down. I paid $900+ for 24 hours of complete frustration. Thank you. You really know how to piss off your guests.

W Singapore - Sentosa Cove,Disappointing experience for Marriott Platinum member,"I was there for a two-night staycation on the first few days of the year-end school holidays, so unfortunately the hotel was completely booked out. I had requested a room upgrade as a Marriott Bonvoy Platinum Elite member. The best they could do was either a Fabulous (room with balcony) or Away Room (with a plunge pool). I chose the Away Room, but regretted it as we barely used the plunge pool, and the room itself wasn't as nice as the Fabulous Room. I was also told that despite being a Platinum member, I could only get either a room upgrade or a late checkout, unlike at other Marriott hotels where both would be offered. They could however give me a late checkout if I did a room swap on my checkout day, which I was willing to do.

Rates have increased considerably (even higher than pre-COVID rates), but service and housekeeping standards have paradoxically dropped; essentially, it feels like you are paying more for less.

From the time you check-in , to the time you check-out, you are always close to someone who prepares to give you an extra hand with a smile. The hotel facilities are, however, a little dated. The rubber trims for shower doors are worn leading to leakage of water to the basin area when you shower. The mattresses are a tad too soft, probably the springs are over-used, that cause our back to ache in the morning. The cane-look chairs in the balcony have many broken plastic strips which are dangerous if you brush any part of your clothe or skin across it.

W Singapore - Sentosa Cove,A superb and quality stay for the family.,"Thank you Nick and Robert for an amazing stay. Being titanium has its perks, however beyond that is their consistency in service. This is a very service orientated hotel, managing all forms of guests, including ours with 3 young infants. For us, it means we run on their schedule and that takes a toll when your at home. At the hotel it all seemed too easy and relaxing, so even as parents we enjoyed the trip. This is our third staycation here and you can see the difference each time. I feel the key change has been mgmt presence that has lifted the teams service ethics. Lead by example and you can see mgmt continuously demonstrating this principal.

The room itself is nice (though the decorating, especially the lamp shade, is a matter of taste) and housekeeping was generally attentive.

Without hassle, the Reservation Team confirmed the upgrade for the connecting room in less than 3 hours!

She was warm, welcoming, efficient and just a complete sweetheart. It was also very nice to meet a fellow Murdoch University alumni despite the obvious age gap!

There were no expectations on any special treatment, just wanted to connect the dots between the stays and why the hotel holds special memories.

W Singapore - Sentosa Cove,A hidden gem in Sentosa,"My family and I have been to Singapore many times and we never knew there was a W. We have stayed in W New York and Melbourne but this is for sure our favourite. The location is in Sentosa Cove which makes the ambience of the hotel more of a resort with a lush and beautiful view of a marina. It is also a quiet area so we managed to enjoy a nice stroll around. The hotel itself is stunning, my kids really liked the W logo in the middle of the driveway. The concierge was very helpful, as we were travelling with kids, there was so much luggage. I believe his name was Zai. The lobby was brightly lit and very crowded but the team were still wonderful. Our check in was smooth and fast, Nishita was fantastic and even gave us complimentary breakfast when we shared that it was our first",5 out of 5,January 2023,5.0 of 5 stars,#12 of 16 hotels in Sentosa Island,0.3880165289256199,0.5777318640955005,69.40082644628099,57.77318640955005,38.80165289256199,Location
W Singapore - Sentosa Cove,Do not recommend,"My stay at W was disappointing and I hope the management team takes this feedback seriously it. I expected a five star service since it was a five star hotel and we were paying so much for one night in a standard room with a horrible view of rocks. Firstly, why design a hotel with such a view? Secondly, when we arrived at the hotel, no one assisted us with opening the car door and just stood around a desk. Only one guy came out to help with our luggages. Still, we were sure that it was just a downtime for them but the check in was the same lapse of service. The Chinese lady that checked us in did not even smile? You’re in the service industry and refuse to smile? The whole registration process took so long.

It was a fabulous room with beautiful view. The balcony was perfect to chill and read. The main highlight was the 24 hours swimming pool.

W Singapore - Sentosa Cove,Overhyped,A very overhyped and expensive hotel that was so underwhelmed and not worth a cent. Nothing compared to other W hotels. This W lacks luxury service standards and do not go above and beyond like other hotels. I would have rather spent the money at another hotel in Sentosa.

I chose the W as I had stayed there a few years ago, and it was lovely. Unfortunately, that no longer appears to be the case.

W Singapore - Sentosa Cove,Could be better,"Our stay this time was not that great compared to the previous stays. Starting with the positive - The staff at the Kitchen Table provided impeccable service. A huge improvement from past stays. Specially kudos to Wai Meng. - Breakfast food was delicious and the kids really enjoyed it. - Pool was beautiful and perfect for the hot Singapore weather. - Housekeeping was really good and friendly. Staff on the 6th floor was always smiling and never failed to greet. Sadly, this stay was dampened by the service from the front desk. It was one of the worst experience and it is sad as just beginning of the year, I wrote a glowing review about the front desk team. Service provided was lacking and slow.

It also came with a fun to ride slide (easy to see the same bunch of kids trying 10 or 20 times and they were still wearing broad smiles on their faces).

We had a great time at the pool as well as the balcony where we had a great view of the pool.,5 out of 5,September 2023,5.0 of 5 stars,#12 of 16 hotels in Sentosa Island,0.6291666666666665,0.7083333333333334,81.45833333333331,70.83333333333334,62.91666666666666,Services

W Singapore - Sentosa Cove,Excellently amazingly phenomenal,Service is way above the bestest Foirseasons I've been to. And I've been to a lot. The front desk beauty was fascinating. She helped above and beyond retrieve my lost phone with Airline. Then the dude at concierge helped arranging someone picking it up. That's just one of many super duper things with this place.,5 out of 5,September 2023,5.0 of 5 stars,#12 of 16 hotels in Sentosa Island,0.3066666666666666,0.4433333333333333,65.33333333333333,44.333333333333336,30.666666666666664,Services
