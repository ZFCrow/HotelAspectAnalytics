Despite our flight landed really early and we arrived by 6am in the Hotel, we were offered breakfast at the Club facilities and within 1.5 hour our room was ready for check in. A truly fantastic service. We booked a Club Deluxe Room and the money was well worth it. Check-in is pretty unspectacular but friendly exclusiv at Level 19 (follow signs Deluxe Lounge). Room was big, fantastic views towards Orchard Road but yet very quiet. Breakfast was delicious an absolutely sufficient for a good start into the day (good coffee). Pool area is nicely decorated.

This negative review is from our personal experience there and is in no way a means to attempt to get a free night. Only pluses were great location, great pool view and decent normal room. Slipped and fell on the morning of the 14th at the pool jacuzzi. With the jacuzzis running, i could not tell that it was curved (other one was angular). The no entry signs were too small to notice. Ended up with a cut toe (pool tiles were sharp) and a bump on the back of my head. I strongly encouraged the hotel to place a barrier preventing access to the jacuzzi section of the pool from the deck. I hope it is now in place in April 2022.

Room was small and basic, the bar is outside by the pool so it is closed when it is raining or thunder warning….. they told me nowhere else to get a relaxing drink in the hotel, sorry bar closed.

While the location was convenient, We encountered several issues that impacted my overall experience. The hotel was overcrowded, lacking sufficient space to relax comfortably. Room service ended early at 9:30 PM, inconveniencing late arrivals. The rooms were small and lacked ample storage, further detracting from the comfort. Additionally, the hotel's refusal to accommodate early check-ins, despite booking almost 35 rooms for an event, was a significant inconvenience. Although the location was a positive aspect, these drawbacks affected our stay at Jen Orchard Hotel.",1 out of 5,July 2023,4.0 of 5 stars,#102 of 372 hotels in Singapore,0.05929752066115703,0.41549586776859504,52.96487603305785,41.549586776859506,5.929752066115703,General

JEN Singapore Orchardgateway by Shangri-La,A Nice Stay,"This is a pretty good hotel. Great location, good service. On day one I had a problem with not getting the room type I had booked but they were most impressive in resolving this quickly. They went above and beyond to make sure we were happy. The Panorama Rooms with the dual vanities in the bathroom are a great room, nice and light and large. My only problem with the hotel is that they have made all the common area's too small for the amount of rooms they have. The pool area (while looking great) is always super crowded, the Club on the weekends is always super crowded and the main restaurant is way too small for the amount of guests. Much better to have breakfast in the Club. Speaking of which, the club was good.

I’ve been to Phuket & Bali over 5 times and I was quite surprised we weren’t greeted in a similar way like getting a cool welcome drink or have our bags brought to our rooms. I booked 2 rooms at a hefty $550 a night for each room which was more than I have paid before but got fooled by the pool and being part of Shangri-La. The rooms are basic with soft pillows making it very uncomfortable. Not sound proof so you do hear other doors closing or people walking down the hallway.

JEN Singapore Orchardgateway by Shangri-La,The Jen Hotel - Completely Disappointing,Stayed at The Jen Hotel Singapore for 5 days after travelling through Vietnam and staying at beautiful hotels for three weeks and it was quite a disappointment. The Hotel certainly has a beautiful rooftop pool and bar with spectacular views of Singapore which in part made up for what the hotel was missing. The train station was also easily accessible from the location and another one of the few bonuses. The Buffet Breakfast required guests to line up for about 15 minutes before being able to go and sit down at a table. The food and beverages were barely worth the wait and the restaurant was noisy with a notice asking guests to not stay longer than 60 minutes. The rooms were clean but very small and basic. The Hotel lacks personality and personal touches.

JEN Singapore Orchardgateway by Shangri-La,Excellent hotel on Orchard Road,Stayed for two nights. Arrived very early on the first day. While there was no room available at the time the staff were friendly and allowed us to use the changing facilities on the roof top and relax by the pool. Room was large and had a great view. Even had a separate closet space which helped the whole place feel less cluttered. Room was well appointed and felt new. Didn't try any of the dining options but looked decent. Pool area was very nice and had a great view. Well located right above Somerset station and Orchard Gateway mall.

JEN Singapore Orchardgateway by Shangri-La,Excellent hotel,"I have just returned from a 10 night stay at this hotel in a Club Room (27 sqm), and I'm pleased to report that it was a very positive experience. Due to the set up of my room, it appeared to be surprisingly spacious, although in saying that, there was only myself staying in the room. I do feel, however, that it would be big enough to comfortably accommodate two people. It was incredibly quiet in the room (on the 18th Floor), with no sound heard from either outside the window or from the corridor. The only thing that might be a problem with more than one person using the room was that the shower and toilet were in separate glass cubicles with the vanity basin situated outside the shower near the bed.

That is not a problem and we left our luggage there. When we came back 10 hours later, the luggage was still at reception. We had to asked to have it brought up to the room. A bit disappointing as I expected the luggage in the room at our return. The room was clean and has a great seat in the window to enjoy the city. The shower and toilet have a separate glass door for privacy but the sink is right in the room. The breakfast was really good. Such a choice of Asian and Western food, fantastic.

On most occasions I am usually in Jen Tanglin but occasionally I decide to stay here especially if I have meetings to attend in the surrounding. The problem I have with this hotel though is due to the famous location they believe they can mess things up for clients as they wish. From my first visit to this hotel in 2016 I have never had one stay that didnt go wrong. And it is happening again tonight. No point to say more about it. There are other hotels along Orchard if you need to stay near. I have blacklisted Jen Orchardgateway. The service gets worse as time goes by.

I think Hotel Jen could do better in up keeping the upholstery. 2, The signage of the toilet (the push and pull) sign didn't give the right direction. 3, The tube to the hose is a bit loose which slows the shower and water leaked from the connection point of the hose.

JEN Singapore Orchardgateway by Shangri-La,"Great Location, Great Breakfast Buffet Spread!","The hotel is great because the room area is bigger compared with the other hotel I stayed in Singapore. The bottle water supply in the room is overwhelming. There is a vendo machine and ice dispencer in every floor. Unfortunately, the rooms we booked had a certain pungent smell. So we needed to spray perfume to overcome it. The pool may be the coolest pool in the world but it is just a plain rectangular pool. They probably won the coolest pool award maybe because it is located at the 19th floor, purified with salted chlorine which is gentler on the hair, skin, eyes, and with a top city view. I liked their breakfast buffet because of its wide selection of food. And you can even take out a coffee and a pastry when you are done to keep you going the rest of the day.

Starting with good - the hotel's location is excellent being located above the Somerset MRT and shopping centre. The check-in staff were very good and the pool is excellent. But things went down hill from there. Firstly the hotel looks dated and needs a design refresh. It looks as though it was designed about 10-15 years ago. I looked up the opening online and was surprised that it was opened only 5 years ago.

It was great to share with the family some memories of our life here 30 years back!

The view from our apartment was really nice and the pool view is just amazing! The F&B at the Lounge should be presented a little bit better, also should be available more variety (not only fruits and biscuits, tea, coffee and soft drinks) for 24h as advertised!

JEN Singapore Orchardgateway by Shangri-La,Great Short Stay,"Pleasant experience staying in this hotel, the customer service (via email) really responded and fulfilled my requests. The front liners also friendly and helpful accomadated my late checkout request due to pray time before leaving hotel. The pool is amazing. Yet the breakfast is not so much (although it has ice cream bar with many flavors and topping) just pricey almost 40sgd with that range of food. The room..(although I have the same issue with other superior room guests: the bath room area too exposed and difficult for us to reach towels or bath robe without seen half naked) but the view from my room was unbeatable awesome.. straight to Orchard road.

JEN Singapore Orchardgateway by Shangri-La,"Great location, small room and a bit overpriced","I stayed overnight on a connection between the U.S. and Thailand. I have to say the best aspect of this hotel is the rooftop pool (apparently named Winner of the Coolest Pool in the World this year) - great views and planted scenery make for a wonderful atmosphere. The room itself was small - which was fine, since I was only there one night - but decently outfitted. Shower water pressure was unexpectedly good, and the window bench seat made for a cozy atmosphere. The bed was comfortable, if a bit low. I knew Singapore is an expensive place to visit before I booked. However, I would have rather stayed at my preferred J.W. Marriott property and paid a similar room price (and received hotel points from Bonvoy).

The location is unbeatable...steps from Orchard Rd and shopping and beautiful Christmas decorations means you don't have to look far for a quick meal or coffee. The lobby is on the 10th floor and there is a concierge to assist guests at the main ground level entrance. I found it to always be staffed with a helpful young person ready to arrange a taxi or help with luggage. Check-in is very modern using tablet computers and electronic signatures and I found it to be ultra-efficient despite a full house.

Always a great experience. The location is amazing, and literally on top of the underground station, which is great for everybody who uses public transport in Singapore. It's also in the center of Orchard Road - a popular shopping area. There are also plenty of restaurants around. It's only a few underground stops away from the financial area of Singapore and the Marina Bay. The service is very efficient. The rooms are relatively simple, but very well designed and functional.

The rooms had USB plugs so we didn't really need our electrical adapters. The only thing comment I would share is that the shower steps into an open space in the room (not door between bathroom area and bedroom area) and the toilet is in a glass enclosure (you can hear everything) so if you are staying with non-so-close friends or if you have different gender sibling ... it may be awkward.

JEN Singapore Orchardgateway by Shangri-La,Gorgeous pool on the rooftop,"Checked in for an overnight stay with friends and the staff couldn’t have been any nicer / friendlier. Took a dip in the hotel pool in the evening and during the day. It has a stunning view of the city and wasn’t crowded at all. The room was a bit disappointing - a little bit cramped, although the view of the city was fantastic. We ordered room service as the restaurant/ bar was closed by the time we had settled in and our food arrived courtesy of the hotel robot, which was fabulous, if not unexpected.",4 out of 5,February 2020,4.0 of 5 stars,#102 of 372 hotels in Singapore,0.0517857142857143,0.7428571428571429,52.589285714285715,74.28571428571429,5.178571428571431,Services
JEN Singapore Orchardgateway by Shangri-La,Excellent overnight stop,Stayed here when we had a 24 hour stopover on the way from the UK to New Zealand. Hotel was very comfortable and everything we wanted in a stopover- the deluxe king room was very good. Lovely pool on the roof. Very good location on Orchard Road above Somerset MTA station.

JEN Singapore Orchardgateway by Shangri-La,Great Location,"My wife and I recently stayed at the Jen Orchardgateway hotel in a Singapore while on a tour. The location was great with shopping and restaurants all over and easily walkable. The room was modern and clean with a great view.The bathroom even had a built in bidet. A breakfast buffet is included with the room and the food was very good with the usual Western food , but also many ethnic choices. The best though is the famed roof top pool. Used it several times and enjoyed the unbelievable views of the city",4 out of 5,February 2020,4.0 of 5 stars,#102 of 372 hotels in Singapore,0.36733333333333335,0.5075555555555555,68.36666666666666,50.75555555555555,36.733333333333334,Amenities

JEN Singapore Orchardgateway by Shangri-La,Typical Singapore Value Veneer,"The Orchard Gatway is not a cheap hotel and it it has the veneer of value and quality typical of Singapore. When you pay so much for a room, you expect things to be right down to the details. For example, why is it not possible to have decent coffee? How can this simple thing be so very difficult to achieve for a hotel that purports to be at such quality levels? You see the beans, hear the transformed before you, yet the end product is less than the worst instant. Yea, seems trivial, but it is not when you are spending more that USD 160 per night. I have to give this hotel credit for service. The staff are falling all over themselves to make the details right and manufacturing excuses for failure they could not possibly control. The gun to the head service mentality you expect",3 out of 5,February 2020,4.0 of 5 stars,#102 of 372 hotels in Singapore,-0.0716153127917834,0.5774976657329599,46.41923436041083,57.74976657329599,7.16153127917834,Value
