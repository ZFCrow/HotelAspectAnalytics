V Hotel Lavender,Very Good Location,"I love the location. The hotel room is small but we managed! Aside from the MTR being just few steps away, there a lot of food choices around the area as well as a grocery! Bus stops are also around the hotel. Neighborhood also feels safe even if we walk at night. We booked for 3 rooms and we requested to be put within the same floor which they did. Each room also comes with a cellphone with unlimited internet access and international phone call. So our group was able to communicate using this. The aircon in one of the 3 rooms where we should be staying was not working and this is the only bad thing about the experience. The maintenance told us that he will inform the front desk so we can change our room, we waited for almost 3 hours and no one calls.

V Hotel Lavender,Ok for what you pay,"Firstly good location in Singapore. It has been noted the rooms are small and that was the case. No problems for us but if you like space then this is probably not the hotel for you. There was a pretty awful smell on level 8 at times and we couldn’t work out what it was. Also the air-con is freezing. We actually had to turn it off to warm ip the room!! If you are after a hotel where they bring your bags up and down from the room this wasn’t our experience, however didn’t bother us personally. The tour booking guy is fantastic by the way. Lots of local knowledge and very helpful. Definitely saved us by being scammed from a taxi driver.

V Hotel Lavender,Probably one of the worst stays in 15 years of travel,"Here is a quick list of pros and cons. Pros: - Proximity to metro station lavender - basically 30 steps away from the hotel door and ideal if you are traveling to or from the airport - mostly escalator and smooth surfaces all the way - ideal to transport your luggage - Big windows, so a view of the city on higher floors - The wifi works pretty well - Relatively private swimming pool (though hygiene questionable) Cons: - From an ecological point of view one of the worst practices I've seen - they throw away your bar of soap every single day and give you a new one in its pack. Please stop this! I wanted to write a note so they would stop it as it irritated and upset me each of the 2 afternoons.

V Hotel Lavender,Our stay in Singapore,Last week we spent 3 nights in the V Lavender Hotel in Singapore. This Hotel was booked for us by Cruise 1st in a package deal. We couldn’t have been happier with the choice. My husband who is nearly 80 was not well when we arrived in Singapore after a 14 day cruise. When we required at Reception and asked whether we could have an early check-in they were very obliging and let us in for no cost. The same happened at checkout when they gave us a late check-out. The Hotel was very nice and clean and the staff were always friendly and helpful.

Found a crockache in the bathroom, and the whole room has this horrible musky smell, ceilings were stained. Spoke to the reception who said that they will do something about it. A week has passed!

V Hotel Lavender,Great Location stay in mid budget,"Its a good hotel, location is plus point as nearest MRT is Lavender just 100 meters away. Apart from that this hotel gives you a Mobile phone with local SIM a good addon. Rooms are clean with big windows and excellent views. But yes rooms are a bit smaller. I will suggest this hotel because of value for money and its great location. Mustafa mall is almost 1.5 Km away, so you can walk or use MRT (Lavender to Ferrar Park) in both cases you will be walking same. I found reception guys a little less polite as compare to other hotels I stayed in Singapore. They need to sound a bit more polite. These guys behaves like a old Government official.

This is a bed factory and in no way does it represent that of a true four star hotel. The room was compact but to be fair the floor area was advertised. The shower room suitable for Lilliputian people only. Breakfast had a total lack of order and was more akin to feeding time at the zoo, certainly not relaxed. The housekeeping chose to leave their trolley out in the corridor overnight (3 nights) which in the event of mass evacuation being required would provide a chokepoint, suspect building inspector might have something to say of this practice.

V Hotel Lavender,Not great if you are a light sleeper,I booked directly through the hotel's website so they avoid having to pay hefty commissions through an online travel agent. Sometimes hotels are thankful by giving you a good room. Not the V Hotel Lavender. I booked the entry level standard room. I was given a room right next to the elevator. Very noisy as people come and go until late at night and the floor does not have carpet there. Also the window looks directly at a wall. The next day I asked whether there was another standard room but was told they are all right next to the elevator. So just be aware of that as the walls / doors are thin.

My wife and my daughter had stayed here before so we went back again. it was her third time or so and for me it was 1st time. the service was horrible. Restaurant service was even worst. For any services we needed, we had to call them. No one really would bother to approach you and ask for any services. Despite of such services, I had to conduct meetings time to time. Employees there seemed not trained or unwilling to work. Besides that housekeepers were rude. They would clean our room partially; half clean only, so time to time we had to call the housekeepers and had to request them to clean it again. During the 11 days stay, we had to book three times, not sure why, it seemed something wrong.

V Hotel Lavender,Great connectivity and clean rooms..,Whenever we plan a holiday we invest so much time to decide the hotel..and after reaching we realise that hotel is not that important part of the trip. With V hotel we were so relaxed as we opted to take rooms without breakfast as there are so many places around to have breakfast.( I enjoyed toast box the most). But the best part of this hotel is just below the hotel is the metro station and just outside is the bus stop. Even for airport transfers we took the metro despite travelling with a 6 year old. Lavender is a decent area with good option for fast food and cafes. Metro and buses are the lifeline of Singapore. I totally enjoyed my stay at V.

V Hotel Lavender,First time stay at V hotel and won't be the last.,"To be honest, at first I was underestimated the hotel as when I was entering the hotel for the first time there is no staff welcoming me or even make an eye contact with me. Not long after that there was 1 Concierge staff I believe, his name is Mr. Henry, he was approaching me and ask wether I need assistance or not. Without any hesitation he explain about the surrounding in the hotel, like how far is the MRT station and where is the convenience store is. This small gesture is actually very important, the way he anticipate what guest need is what hotelier should have. Sometimes you can feel the ""fakeness"" in people smile but I did not see it on Mr. Henry. The way he approach guest one by one and answer every single guest inquiries is very sincere.

V Hotel Lavender,"Great location for a single traveller, easy access to the subway and several bus routes","This was my third or fourth time staying at the V Hotel Lavender. It is situated on top of the MRT station making it super easy to access from the train and bus routes. The rooms are more compact than many other places in the parts of the world, but are fine compared to other large cities in Asia. It is a simple transition from the airport by train as long as your flight arrives before the last train which is just before midnight. Usually hotel check in is quite smooth, but the hotel has just transitioned to a new booking/operating system and everything took so much longer than normal, even when I arrived after 1 am and there was no one else at the desk. I actually had to show the check in clerk my booking as he couldn't find it in the new system.

V Hotel Lavender,Terrified with the Alarms at Lavender !!,I had booked for 5 nights with my husband and toddler child The rooms are far too small for a family of 3. (2adults and a child). The bathrooms have an unpleasant smell although after the room service was done the smell wouldn’t go away at all. The breakfast options are repeated after every two days so you won’t really enjoy the breakfast here specially if you’re an Indian traveller.. I asked a plate and a spoon from the restaurant. For that they taur a security deposit of $10 per plate per spoon. You return the plate and spoon in the original condition you get your money back. This is the first hotel I’ve seen who charges for cutlery 😐😐 !!! We were given a room on the 13th floor. Any type of an alarm means it’s an emergency for the guests inside the hotel.

V Hotel Lavender,Family friendly hotel with great staff and easy access to everything!,"The place was a standard 4 star Singapore Hotel but what made the experience worth while were a couple of things: 1. The location, you can access everything, great food, we were able to eat at a Michelin star hawker centre that’s a walk away and 2 Michelin mentioned restaurants which were also close. It’s surrounded by everything, pharmacies, teas, hawker centres and even a hospital and one of the best laundromats in the city. 2. Transportation is so easy. The MRT is right in front of the hotel. And so is a bus station. (Use maps is really helpful to navigate what buses and trains to take for wherever you want to go. 3. The staff. Everyone was so helpful and nice. Even at odd hours of the day.

V Hotel Lavender,Not at all roccmended,"The rooms in the hotel were too small. We booked twin bed as queen bed shown in photos looked too small. There was only space of 2 beds in room and that's it. In years of travel this is the smallest room that I have seen in my life at the price which they took. Booked 3 months back and the charged 1200 dollars or 75000 INR for 8 days. Was getting other good hotels like mercure on stevens for 1300-1400 dollars, but due to location booked v lavender. And that was the only good thing in hotel - location. The staff was ok. Some staff is rude and doesn't smile at all. Some staff is good. Room service staff is also okayish. Sometimes they don't respond after multiple calls, sometimes the service is good.
