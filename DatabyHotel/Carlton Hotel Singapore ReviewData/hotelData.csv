Carlton Hotel Singapore,Very Disappointed,"BE AWARE WHEN BOOKING. Avoid to book the premier room. My recommendation would be to go somewhere else. We booked this hotel an executive room and we upgraded to a Premier Room because it was mentioned the room comes with a city or bay view. This was a VERY BAD MISTAKE. When i checked in, they gave me a room without a city or bay view. Even tried to explain to the front desk staff by showing my reservation's confirmation that it mentioned the room's view is city or bay, but the staff told me ""the city or bay view is subject to availability! If we knew this before we booked, we would have booked elsewhere.",2 out of 5,October 2023,4.0 of 5 stars,#106 of 372 hotels in Singapore,-0.2894444444444444,0.48333333333333334,35.52777777777778,48.333333333333336,28.94444444444444,Services

Rooms are very spacious with an open washroom concept which had a slight foul smell filling up the room as well coming from the drainage due to the lack of proper exhaust / ventilation.

Carlton Hotel Singapore,convenient ++,"I stayed at the Carlton for the 2017 SG GP, so this review is weighted towards this event. It's fantastically located hotel for the GP and well priced. You have access to three MRT stops within close walking distance, so very easy to get around to most parts of the island, including gp zone 1 priority gate. The hotel is only a block away from zone 4 and couple of blocks to the Pandang stage.

Carlton Hotel Singapore,Carlton Hotel Singapore,"It's been a while since I have reviewed a hotel. The last time I put a review up for a place in Singapore was not so positive so decided to put up a review on my next visit. I have stayed in many hotels since my last review but never posted any good reviews for which I apologise for. I will try to put up positive ones in the future as well. Well, on to Carlton Hotel Singapore. Had a three night stay. Well, first impression was that the hotel is nicer that I thought it would be from the online photos. The service was very good overall during the stay. Location was excellent, just 300 from Raffles and the metro station. I included the breakfast buffet during my stay. It was large for a breakfast buffet; the variety was quite large compared to most.

Carlton Hotel Singapore,Good option,Was in town for a few days for a conference that happened to be hosted at the Carlton. I opted to stay at the Carlton rather than my usual hotel across the road. The hotel is in the heart of the Singapore..opposite raffles city shopping mall and close to the train/ metro. Check was easy and lobby is always a hive of activity. The coffee shop in the lobby is quite enough for a short business meeting and good quality is decent. Rooms are average size for Singapore.I found the bed mattress and pillows too soft. Bathroom was small. Room service menu does not have too many vegetarian options. Breakfast was a decent spread each day. Overall a decent 4 star hotel and decent value for the price you pay.,4 out of 5,September 2017,4.0 of 5 stars,#105 of 372 hotels in Singapore,0.10333333333333333,0.4600000000000001,55.166666666666664,46.00000000000001,10.333333333333334,Value

Just a 10 minute walk from Marina Bay and Raffles City is just across the road for the Metro links and shops and lots of food choices. The rooms are large and clean with great views of the city, also you get a free of charge mobile to help you find your way around the city and make calls which is extremely helpful if you cannot use your phone in Asia. Also the phone has lots of discount codes for attractions around the city and Sentosa.

Carlton Hotel Singapore,Nice hotel in a good location,"The Carlton Hotel is quite nice and in a central location. The lobby was a great place to meet with colleagues and always had a bit of buzz going on. The rooms were nice. Not huge but had all of the features that I require. It's a fairly large hotel, but you never had to wait for an elevator. The only problem I had was that the gym and pool area didn't open until 7AM. That doesn't work for those on business as you don't have enough time to work out before the day starts. The one time I was able to get to the gym, I found it to be nice and well equipped. Because not getting into the gym before work is a deal-breaker for me, I likely wouldn't stay here again.

I will definitely stay here again if they are giving away rooms for a good rate. When we stayed in Oct 2017, the rates were much less compared to Stanford hotel. No regrets.

Carlton Hotel Singapore,The Great Indifference,"The feeling we took away from our weekend at the Carlton was one of indifference - from the reservations to the check-in to the room service. The tone is that of casual disinterest. You ask for X and they will give you X but with very few niceties. It puts the ""business"" in the ""business hotel"". It is a pity as I recall service was a lot better years ago when we held our wedding banquet at the hotel. This is also why we decided to have a family staycation there around the time of my wedding anniversary. I told the reservations the reason for my stay while booking. A more attentive hotel would have given us a wedding anniversary greeting during our check-in. Sure, the location is great and the room is clean but it was really the details that let down.

Fantastic location for getting to all the places you want to see whilst in Singapore. As to the hotel facility's themselves,all very,very good. Room was spacious,clean and modern. Outside area,again,very good. The only downside,and it's not a big critism,is the breakfast meal. Food us very good and at a high standard,but I would suggest going as early as possible,as it gets really busy.

From the time I made the reservation, they were already very attentive to the request we put in and we had several correspondence via email. The staff were very polite and friendly.

Our server during breakfast was very attentive and remembered that my mom asked for hot chocolate the first time we were there and she made it for her again the next day.

Carlton Hotel Singapore,GOOD VALUE HOTEL,"My family and I stayed for 2 nights (which included New Years Eve) on our way to Europe. I tried booking some other hotels in Singapore, but their rates were ridiculously high over New Year’s Eve. The rates at the Carlton Hotel were very good, so I went ahead and booked this hotel. The location of the hotel is excellent. My son and I used the gym, and I would rate it as a very good hotel gym. The hotel has an outdoor swimming pool. However, we found the water temperature to be a bit cold, probably because it was located between two buildings and didn’t seem to get much sunlight. The buffet breakfast was very good and had a varied selection. We stayed in two deluxe rooms. The rooms were adequate but nothing special and I would rate the rooms 4 star.

Much like the Shangri-La Hotel Line restaurent today. When you rate a hotel the standard of its buffet and menus are an essential part of that assessment. For this reason I have given a hotel that should get a 4 in all rights as a 4 Star Hotel the rating of a 3. The buffet was poorly thought out. For example there was a beef roast and when I asked what was made to,3 out of 5,January 2018,4.0 of 5 stars,#105 of 372 hotels in Singapore,0.0784090909090909,0.4227272727272727,53.92045454545455,42.272727272727266,7.84090909090909,Amenities

The location is great—SMU is across the street, it is walking distance to many tourist attractions and shopping, and there is an MRT station right next door.

No enclosed robes so your hanging clothes visible. No block out curtains, just see thru type. In the afternoon and evening the sun streams thru and makes it difficult to see TV. We had need to call ""Engineering:"" for three issues, one is a design fault with the shower. Don't use the ""rain"" shower head as water will leak into toilet area.

On the 'basic' side the room was standard, painted neutral, no artwork, no kettle, coffee or tea, bar fridge had one Beer and some soft drinks. Pool Bar was pretty ordinary. We went out for dinner! On our return Premium Club promised Cocktails and Canapés as part of the room cost. This is false marketing and on arrival at the Premium Club Lounge dressed to code, we were greeted by a gentleman who asked for our room number and what would we like to drink. I asked for a Martini and my husband for a Lemon, lime and bitters. Oh no we cannot make either of those drinks.",1 out of 5,June 2018,4.0 of 5 stars,#105 of 372 hotels in Singapore,-0.16057692307692312,0.5519230769230768,41.97115384615384,55.192307692307686,16.05769230769231,General

Carlton Hotel Singapore,"Beautiful studio room, but subpar service a disappointment","Stayed in a studio room for two nights in preparation for our wedding at a church in the vicinity. The room itself was clean and spacious, beautifully laid out and with excellent views of the city from the bedroom and bathroom windows, while the breakfast spread on both mornings was tasty and varied. Despite the beautiful room, service was subpar in comparision from the moment we stepped into the hotel. Firstly, both the porter at the door and the staff at the check-in counter were curt and not very welcoming. When we enquired whether it was possible to have our wedding car wait at the main entrance for about 10-15 minutes to pick us up for the wedding the next morning, we were flatly refused, and told that such waiting would have to be done in the basement carpark.

We paid the extra money for the club room and are so glad we did. The staff were wonderful and helpful. The club room was great and had a great view from the balcony towards MBS and the city skyline. Our whole experi nice of this supposedly 4 star motel was 5 star service. We didn’t fly out until 9pm and they arranged for us to have a 6pm checkout. Service plus in our opinion. They have a pool and a spa and there were children there if you have a young family. Easy access for cabs and buses within walking distance.

Carlton Hotel Singapore,just awesome - service / room / location,"didn't expect much as it's the Carlton not Ritz Carlton. But it's an awesome hotel! no snootiness like at RC. service staff are super friendly. Premier Room is superb with great view to the bay, the singapore eye, etc. GREAT GREAT location. just next to the renovating Raffles Hotel, across the street from a major shopping mall, tons of small eats around, and 5 minutes walk to Suntec City Convention Center and, yes another mall. the only draw back is the lobby bar will not let you charge to your room account as it's not operated by hotel. otherwise, great food, great staff, great room, and awesome location. it's closer to the airport as well as opposed to the orchard / scott road hotels.

The room was quite OK and relatively spacious but not as spacious as the Swissotel over the road. Nevertheless, the quality of this hotel is somewhat superior to it's neighbours! I was there for an overnight stay so cannot comment on the quality of the facilities but the lobby was spacious but with inadequate seating. The service was pretty good although I would rate it at 80%. Check in staff were very good and housekeeping excellent but bell service could do with some attention from management.

Staff were very accommodating from checkin to helping at the taxi queue to baggage storage and serving you at the Club lounge. What could have been better was the layout of the bathroom, it was a little cool after taking a bath because of its layout and.design. Another important area of improvement would be the way the BACON is cooked. It seems to be drenched in oil and has a different taste. Hope this can be improved.

Because we tought this was cheep we repeated 9 sgd to her and she confirmed that we heard right. We went in to the breakfast room and after we had started eating, they came with a bill of almost 80 sgd!! We tried to complain, but whit the lousy service on this hotel it did not help. He simply just said that the price was 80 sgd and that all the staff on the hotel knew the price. He also said that the receptionist refused to say anything else. So we had no choice but to pay 80 sgd for a bad breakfast. This is what i call lousy service, and i will never stay at this",1 out of 5,December 2018,4.0 of 5 stars,#105 of 372 hotels in Singapore,-0.14226190476190473,0.5932539682539683,42.886904761904766,59.32539682539682,14.226190476190473,Value

Carlton Hotel Singapore,the most enjoyable cocktail evening time,"the first time I have stayed in this Carlton Hotel in Brasbasah Rd, with the deciding factor is strategically location next to Raffles City. it is the fact that you just need to cross the road then you are in Raffles city, where you may find al kind of resto and also for shopping your grocery in Market Place super market. The check in was fabulous which they allowed us to get into our room earlier than the normal check in time 14.00.

Carlton Hotel Singapore,Good choice,My wife and I spent a night here en route to Tokyo from Cape Town. We arrived in Singapore early in the morning (6am)and I booked two nights so that we had access to a room when we arrived. The hotel is very comfortable and proved to be really convenient for our plan to spend the morning on the “hop on hop off” bus to get an overview of Singapore and the afternoon shopping. The bus terminal is only a few blocks walk and Raffles shopping centre (excellent) is across the road. Raffles Hotel is next door should you want to try a Singapore Sling. Our room was great for an overnighter....... the glass partition between the beds and bathroom is not a preference but happily the toilet had a frosted glass door (even after 40 years of marriage we like our privacy).

Carlton Hotel Singapore,Just fine.,"The location is my favorite feature of this hotel. It's right in front of Chijmes which is full of options to eat and also across a mall. Several bus stops are within the area so it's also very easy to go around. Only thing that bothered me a little was the layout of the room. When you enter you are immediately greeted by the bathroom sink on your right side. Kind of bizarre as it doesn't really have a partition. Anyway, it was ok but for the price you can get larger rooms with adequate cabinets. Our room didn't have one and you may obly hang your clothes through an open rod.

We arrived at 730 in the morning tired after a night flight and did not expect such an early check in.

All staff in the hotel gave us the best overall service we have experienced on our travels. Great room and comfy bed including very quiet. Excellent area to stay for tourist attractions.

Carlton Hotel Singapore,Excellent base for a family of four,"We were a family of four, with two children under 4. We stayed for 6 nights. Priorities for us were a convenient location, clean facilities, enough space for all the family and luggage. The Carlton ticked all of these, however, it does come at a price. Service-wise, there was no real fault at all. You're met on arrival, luggage taken to the room and check-in was fairly swift. The only thing some might have an issue with is that they do take a deposit. I personally didn't have a big problem with this and the deposit was about 275 SGD. This is to cover things like the minibar I guess, and the full amount was refunded to me. We had breakfast included and the staff there were friendly, especially towards the children.

Carlton Hotel Singapore,No sleep in our room,"I have stayed at Carlton hotel Singpaore before without any problems. During the first night of our recent stay there was an intermittent loud noise coming from what I think was the AC. About every 40 minutes during the whole night there was a 10 seconds shrill loud noise which made it impossible to sleep. I even recorded the sound with my phone before going down to the front desk. I played the noise for them and they said they were sorry and offered another room on a lower floor. The only compensation that was offered was free breakfast. I think that when you BKK a room in a hotel at @Carlton Hotel Singapore, you are mostly paying for a good night sleep. If that is impossible to get in the room that was given to you. Should you then have to pay for that? I think not.

Carlton Hotel Singapore,Formula One,I stayed recently for the Formula One event and The Carlton Hotel Singapore is great value for money when compared to the other 5 star hotels slightly closer to the circuit.It is a lot lower price than other nearby hotels but offers a really quick entry through Gate 3.The location is perfect and has Raffles City shopping complex directly over the road.Also Chijmes is across the road and Clarke and Boat Quay are around a 15 minute walk.Chinatown is a little further but easy to walk to in around 20 minutes or so.The rooms are spacious and comfortable and I heard no noise when sleeping.The bed is great and the hotel staff efficient and friendly.I had breakfast as part of the deal and a great selection here.All up a really nice hotel close to the Formula One Circuit and really great,5 out of 5,September 2019,4.0 of 5 stars,#105 of 372 hotels in Singapore,0.29236111111111107,0.5611111111111111,64.61805555555556,56.111111111111114,29.236111111111107,Location

Carlton Hotel Singapore,Very good,"Huge hotel ideally placed for both business and tourist interests delivered pretty much what I would expect. I’ve seen several critical reviews of staff but I found from check in to concierge to cleaning staff everyone was smiling and genuinely helpful The room was generic hotel but none the worse for that. Highlights were the fabulous mattress and efficient air-conditioning. The bath was a little small and the control for drain plug was near broken and I had to twice get staff to come and let out the water. Most disappointed though that lying there in my bubble bath I could only see the tv through the plate glass divider as there was no sound. Staff told me despite there being a speaker in the ceiling and a volume control it wasn’t actually wired up.

For God's sake I was not at McDonald's.Fruits not cut well,just some chunks cut and thrown in for breakfast. To maintain the start rating the food has to be displayed well Not adequate staff.A queue to get your eggs made is a terrible idea. And then to collect again.

Carlton Hotel Singapore,ALMOST TOP NOTCH!,"First off, this is a fantastic hotel! The rooms are excellent. We had a premier club room and it was fantastic. The club lounge is one of the best I have ever had the pleasure to frequent. We were looked after by Dian and Hat and they were amazing! All the staff here are excellent, they will do anything to make sure your stay is enjoyable. The selection of food in the lounge for both breakfast and canapés in the evening was very, very good. The only downside (which is the reason the Carlton hasn't received 5 out of 5) is the Wi-Fi. It is really awful, it's advertised as high speed but believe me it isn't and that really makes a difference. The TV is limited so if you want to catch up with the news back home or (as we did stream live football game,) it was problematic.

Carlton Hotel Singapore,Great location and room - good service,"I stayed here for 4 nights in November 2019. Good size rooms, good service, and good value. Booked a club room, didn't have time to make use of it other than breakfast, but it was nice to have a quiet breakfast with a view on the top floor. They stocked up with water every day in the room and as long as you have club access you can pick up still water from there at any time during the day The one thing I wish they could improve is the WIFI. It worked very well in the room, but I had trouble getting online in the club lounge and in the lobby area. They also didn't have pocket WIFI for rent so that all in all is the reason why I don't give them a full score Other than that I would definitely use this hotel again The one thing i wish they could improve is the WIFI.

For work there is uninterrupted high speed WIFI, a nice spacious desk and chair with a lovely City view, and as a bonus there is a view of the Cathedral for a reminder of the spiritual. It seems the rooms facing other directions have views of other churches.

Carlton Hotel Singapore,Terrible service from a DUTY MANAGER - Ben KUAN,"I arrived at 1205pm for an early check in and finished the check in around 120pm. This was after calling the hotel over the last couple of days to check on what I need to do so I can make my stay pleasurable. I was attended to by the Duty Manager Ben Kuan (I didn't know he was a duty manager at that point) There was another guy, who had cleared another customer and was serving the one in front of me. Ben had unfortunately taken a longer time to serve his customer. After showing him my booking, he asked for my NRIC (cos I am Singaporean, so we don't need to produce our passport), which I showed a soft copy to him. He typed something then asked for the physical NRIC, which I told him I didn't have it. And that is when the nightmare started.

Not sure if they renovated it recently - Big sized bathtub - Early check-in Negatives: - Service is the worst I’ve experienced in any Singapore hotel. - Right from the start at check-in we knew we were gonna be continuously disappointed. We had the quietest check-in with Adrian who didn’t even greet us or ask us for our ICs. We just stood there staring at him with zero conversation or personalisation. He did not even go through the reg card with us just simply asked us to sign at the bottom. Didn’t tell us what room we booked for, how many nights or any safety measures. Hello, Covid???

Every time after housekeeping had cleaned the room, the aircon always malfunctions, being stuck at 64 degrees.

Other benefits of being situated in such a great place is that everything you need and want can be found within easy walking distance, shopping and food at the Raffles City mall across the road or at Suntec further afield, bars and restaurants at Chijmes, and of course, the (overpriced and exaggerated) Singapore Sling at the Raffles Hotel Long Bar.

Carlton Hotel Singapore,Good for business travelers,"I stayed here on someone else's dime (work) so I can't really speak to value, but as a business traveler I can say that I would recommend it. So many hotels ignore the business traveler these days and don't provide a good desk or chair for working in your room. It's not the case with the Carlton. There's a nice, wide, desk with a real office chair and ample electrical outlets. The desk is in the window, so you have a nice view as you work away.

Carlton Hotel Singapore,Clean and tidy great location,"For our recent stop in Singapore we opted to use the Carlton Hotel Singapore as our base. The hotel is in a great spot with easy access to MRT and bus stops to get you around. Walking is also an option however the miles soon start to add up, combined with the heat it's best to try and utalise the transport to lighten the load on the feet. I was a little disappointed upon check in as there was queues. It seemed that Air crew, particularly Cathay Pacific staff stood out, taking priority, not necessarily the hotels fault as they seemed quite rude, pushy and demanding. I would recommend introducing an airline only check in to get them in line. We experienced this issue a number of times. A very poor reflection on Cathay Pacific staff specifically.
