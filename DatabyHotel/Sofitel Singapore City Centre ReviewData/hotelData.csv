Sofitel Singapore City Centre,"Compliment for Ibrahim, Rey, Moghan, Clemence, Taufek & Sharvin","The purpose of writing this is to compliment your hotel staffs for their wonderful service. Thanks to your staff for making it such a comfortable stay at your Sofitel. I was there for 3 days and for all these days I was attended with utmost warmth. I was impressed to see the prompt check in service to Racines despite the peak season. Every need was catered with utmost perfection making me & my guests feel so important. I would like to compliment Ibrahim, Rey, Moghan, Clemance Taufek & Sharvin for being so professional. With smile on their faces, they have been really very impressive in their service. And I would like to visit your hotel again for this outstanding experience.",5 out of 5,September 2023,5.0 of 5 stars,#15 of 372 hotels in Singapore,0.49000000000000005,0.6575,74.5,65.75,49.00000000000001,Services
Sofitel Singapore City Centre,Great food and service,"The food is still as good as before. We had the Ngoh Hiang which came piping hot with a great chilli dip, laksa, which was a super generous portion and tasted really authentic and the fried Hokkien Mee (my mum’s favorite), which tastes really good. All dishes can rival those found in street side stalls and has the “wok hei”. Service by Ibrahim and Rey was attentive without being intrusive. We were warmly welcomed by them and taken care of by them throughout.
