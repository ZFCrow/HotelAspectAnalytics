Village Hotel Bugis by Far East Hospitality,Good all round option in Singapore,"The hotel has several things going in its favour: 1. Centrally located, convenient to easily reach many attractions or even office locations 2. Many shops and eateries in close proximity, serving a variety of cuisines 3. Large and comfortable rooms with modern amenities 4. Quick access to the metro stations - there are 3 stations within 5-8 mins walk 5. Nice swimming pool :-) We did not have any meals at the hotel, so no comments on the in-house dining aspect. Given the vast variety of eateries nearby, food was never an issue, including the nearby Little India area where we went often. Breakfast was SGP $25 per head, a bit steep, so we did not opt for it. The one thing we did not like about the hotel was that there is no lobby area to sit and wait.

Village Hotel Bugis by Far East Hospitality,,"I recently had stay at Village Hotel and I wanted to share some feedback regarding my experience. While I enjoyed my stay overall, I did encounter a situation that left me somewhat disappointed. When I requested breakfast for an additional guest, I was informed that there would be an extra charge. In my past stays at various hotels, it has often been customary to accommodate extra breakfast guests without an additional fee. I believe that a more accommodating policy in this regard could significantly improve the guest experience at Village Hotel. This might include considering a more flexible approach for accommodating additional breakfast guests, which could help set Village Hotel apart as a customer-centric establishment.

She then advised ist o pay at the hotel lobby for a cheaper at $20+. Went down, queued and waired in line. Hotel reception said it could only be bought for an entire stay instead of just 1 meal. With time wasted, we grabbed breakfast outside but my kid wasnt interested so we know she had to eat at the hotel breakfast. So i went back to the breakfast and now the staff allowed for 2 adults.

Village Hotel Bugis by Far East Hospitality,Unexpected Parking Fee,"We chose this hotel primarily for its free parking facility, which was an important consideration for us as we traveled from Malaysia to Singapore. Throughout our time in Singapore, we utilized public transportation for getting around the city. However, during our check-out process, we were surprised to be charged a $10 parking fee. This was due to not re-entering the parking area through the entrance on a daily basis. Unfortunately, this unexpected charge left us with an insufficient balance to cover the $2 toll and $6 road charge when we cleared Singapore customs. As a result, we had to pay a $10 penalty as an admin service fee for making a payment over the counter.

Village Hotel Bugis by Far East Hospitality,Overall a nice and comfortable stay,"Overall my family and I had a nice and comfortable 3 days 2 nights stay in this hotel though the TV in the room is old and poor resolution. The staff at front desk is polite and friendly.
