Singapore Marriott Tang Plaza Hotel,Comfortable enough room but other aspects very disappointing,"Having experienced other Marriott Executive Lounges around the world, this was sadly lacking. It's a fairly large space but very crowded with underwhelming food choices in the evening. Breakfast, depending on which chef was working the eggs station, was either wonderful or disappointing. But the biggest issue with the lounge was the staff. The first answer to any request, no matter how small, was no. There was certainly no sense of hospitality, until we found a great staff member on our final day who seemed genuinely warm and engaging. Room was OK, although aspects of it looked a bit tired. It was certainly quiet enough at night and given the location at the heart of Orchard Road that was a bonus.",3 out of 5,August 2017,5.0 of 5 stars,#80 of 373 hotels in Singapore,0.15456349206349207,0.6162037037037036,57.72817460317461,61.62037037037036,15.456349206349207,Services

Singapore Marriott Tang Plaza Hotel,2+ Months at Marriott Tang Plaza,"5 of 5 · I stayed at the Marriott Tang Plaza for 2+ months on business. I'm Marriott Platinum so I used the Concierge Lounge daily. The lounge has a more compact menu version of the lobby buffet. The food is really good. The lounge isn't huge, but it's big enough to accommodate the crowd on an average day. The lobby buffet is expensive for breakfast, but try it once, even if you're not staying there. It's the most diverse offering of local foods I've ever experienced at a hotel restaurant. Everything is fresh and tastes amazing. Being there without my wife to judge me, I ate everything from soup to eggs to ice cream for breakfast. Marriott Tang Plaza is right above the MRT inside the ION mall.

This is perhaps on of the most disappointing High Tea I've ever been too. The food was as best mediocre. It felt almost like they filled the tray from the buffet line. Nothing on the tray wowed me. The savories included sandwiches, pastry puffs and mini quiches. The sandwiches had decent filling though the bread was dry, the sort you have at a breakfast meeting.. the pastry were not crispy, just gives an oily aftertaste after your first bite, honestly you'd think Old Chang Kee exceled compared to their version of curry puff.. The sweets consisted of mini donuts, a slice of rose cake, macaroons, scones and random stuff.

Singapore Marriott Tang Plaza Hotel,Great Stay- especially the lounge,Stayed at this property for 2 nights while attending a business conference as a Marriott Gold. Property did not provide an upgrade (seems to be standard for this property- which is unfortunate). Property did extend Club access and breakfast benefits. Breakfast in the Marriott Cafe was great- very extensive spread. The newly renovated Marriott Club was well-stocked and the service was excellent. Took a conference call in the Club one morning and the staff recommended a quiet corner. Club benefits include a complimentary one-piece pressing of a garment. The property may wish to consider accepting a two-piece suit as a single garment- which will make this benefit more usable (it's listed as a single line item on the laundry folio!) Overall good stay.

The buffet has most things for everyone including western, seafood, Indian, pasta and Chinese but I think could do with more vegetarian choices. I’m not vegetarian but I like vegetables. All the food choices are available in one central location which is better than having to walk to different sections of a restaurant to get a variety of food you want. It’s a little bit more expensive than some of the buffets in town but I think still good value for money.

Singapore Marriott Tang Plaza Hotel,So pleased I chose here !,After some deliberation I chose the Marriott Tang Plaza as our place to stay for five days. Goodness me this was so the right choice. From the moment we stepped out of the taxi and were greeted with a friendly smile and a much appreciated bottle of cold water from the first of many friendly staff I knew we were going to be happy here. Check in was very smooth. Normally check in isn’t till 2pm and we had arrived off an early flight from NZ arriving before 9am in the morning. It was lovely to be told our room was ready so we were able to head up and freshen up. I had booked a studio room and had made a note that if possible we would like a quiet room. We were on floor 22 and the whole time we were there I think we only heard one other guest. There was no issue with outside street,5 out of 5,August 2018,5.0 of 5 stars,#80 of 373 hotels in Singapore,0.21574829931972794,0.5334467120181408,60.7874149659864,53.34467120181407,21.574829931972793,General

Singapore Marriott Tang Plaza Hotel,"Comparing Marriott, Hilton, Hyatt, Mandarin Oriental","I have been coming to Singapore for over 13 years and have stayed at several hotels over those years. Below are my thoughts on the Marriott with some points of comparison with other hotels like the Hilton, Hyatt and the Mandarin Oriental. Rooms - clean - nice bathroom (no bathtub!) - you will get pretty much similar quality of room with the others. - Marriott has outlet plugs in many useful places, including next to the bed. That is a plus. Mandarin Oriental does not. - plugs are a little loose for the EU adapters. EU adapters just falls or pops back out. US adapter types fit ok. - Showing a little age but still nice - closet is very poorly designed! Drawers on the right side of the closet cannot be opened without both the left and right side of the doors to be opened.

Singapore Marriott Tang Plaza Hotel,High quality hotel,"Dear hotel team, First of all thank you for a stay and wish you the best in development of your nice hotel! In general, we loved the hotel so much and wish you all the best! Some details below: CHECK-IN\OUT (10\10). Very fast and friendly. On a second day did a room change (for a one big bed) and all was fine, without any questions. ROOM (8\10). Room is great, you will have everything you need, bed is so great (as usual for Marriott), cleaning service was also without any questions. The only minor minus - bathroom and specifically a sink. After stopping the hand washing you will still listen to the water sounds inside the pipes system for a while. It is not critical, but a little bit weird. BREAKFAST (10\10). Breakfast is incredible.

Waited for almost 20 min. During check-in, no upgrades were given and offered even after asking. ( Their website still have pool terrace rooms and suites available). This is not the first time happening at this property. From my experience and from other reviews here, it seems that 90% of the time upgrades were given to caucasians more on a regular basis.

Singapore Marriott Tang Plaza Hotel,Great food - good location - very helpful when in a crisis!,We stayed at The Marriot Tang in January as part of a luxury escapes package which included daily breakfast and access to the executive club. I have never had a better buffet breakfast. There was a huge variety to choose from and it was all very fresh. Delicious. The food in the evening in the executive club was also wonderful.

Firstly, i have 4 children who r less than 7 yrs old and it's a hassle to handle them if the service staff r not helpful or anticipate our needs. We were served in a way that, "" that is ur seat"", doesn't seem like concern for us. That was the first impression. However along the way, it was fine as we managed to settle down. My advice is that for future if there is any young children, it will be",1 out of 5,April 2019,5.0 of 5 stars,#80 of 373 hotels in Singapore,0.07330246913580246,0.42160493827160495,53.66512345679012,42.160493827160494,7.330246913580246,Value

One of the four hotel elevators was broken and the other three were not functioning properly in terms of reading key cards. On Saturday, I had to have my key cards re-programmed three times. This was only done to supposedly fix the problem but the real problem was not the card but the card reader in the elevator. And it only malfunctions on the way down not up, so as often as the front desk attendant tried to “confirm” the new card worked, since they didn’t try it on the way down, it all looked good!

Rooms - Rooms are a little dated, but otherwise well maintained. Can't stand the musty smell though, more effort should be done to mask the smell. There was a reed diffuser in the room but it was already finishing and housekeeping did not bother to change it. We also asked for foam pillows but it was not given so we had a poor sleep. Food - We only had the breakfast buffet but it was excellent.

Singapore Marriott Tang Plaza Hotel,Amazing location,I don't think the location could be any better for this property. However in Singapore everything is nearby by MRT. Room is spacious and offers basic amenities. No stand to keep the suitcase on. Study table is small. However clean and decent. A bit noisy because of rectification work at 5th floor. Good spacious lobby area. Staff are nice but experienced a bit slow service.

From 3-430pm, I could only hear drilling and jackhammering, which was particularly unpleasant since I was sick.

Service is good but the concierge cannot be depended upon. They screwed up my lunch and dinner reservation. They could not even deliver newspaper as promised and has to be corrected. The food at their cafe is poor and the Chinese restaurant is always full because it has very few seatings. The main dining hall is small but cosy.

Singapore Marriott Tang Plaza Hotel,GLORY DAYS.... PAST MANY YEARS AGO,"Having stayed at Marriott properties for the past 25 years, brand loyalty has been very important to me. I have been very complimentary and written glowing emails to the management of properties when the service has been exemplary. However, with the Marriott Tang Plaza.... this is definitely not the case. For so many years, this was a showcase property and worthy of the room rates that they charge. However, as my title says.... the Glory days have definitely passed. The condition of the room was rather substandard compared to what I have been accustomed to when staying at JW Marriott properties. There was no Welcome amenity. The room showed evidence of mold. Excessive flooding around the shower because of inadequate rubber molding.

Singapore Marriott Tang Plaza Hotel,Glory days are gone,This is a historic place and the the only good thing about this hotel is it is under the Marriott brand and the location. The sad part is the hotel management needs to be more hands on in their operations. When I checked in the luggage took 30mins to arrive to my room. I kept calling the concierge asking for my luggage. Their wonton noodle soup is tasteless. Its like food for the sick. Their spaghetti was “okay” their presentation was not close to a 5 star presentation. The break looks pathetic. The elevator is also very slow despite staying at the 8 floor. I had to wait 15 mins to get a ride to go to the ground floor. They decided to repair 1 elevator during rush hour.

The pushbutton lighting works very well with controls by the bed - sometimes those systems are finicky but not here.

The hotel is also connected with underpass hence you are able to hop from malls to malls without getting wet or under the hot sun. It is also connected directly to the MRT (Subway) Orchard Station. This hotel is probably the best location in the entire Singapore in terms of strategic location, accessibility and connectivity.

Singapore Marriott Tang Plaza Hotel,Good choice for a 2 night staycation,"Stayed here for 2 nights in Sep taking advantage of a very good credit card deal. Breakfast was included in the Marriott cafe. Lounge was closed due to the Covid situation, but evening drinks and some limited food was made available also in the Marriott cafe in the lobby. We had a very nice corner room. Reasonably quiet, just a little stomping noise from the upstairs neighbours. Small pool on level 5 (I didn't use it). Great location in the centre of Orchard. TV didn't allow casting from mobile device unfortunately. Dual rain showers in bathroom, but no bath. Decent sized room. Very fast free wifi.

Room was spacious and bed very comfortable. The executive club lounge was relocated to the 5th floor, a bit small & was only opened in the evening from 5:30-9:30pm.

It was odd to say the least, but given the labour crunch these days, this is the best arrangement; as opposed to setting up and manning a counter. The registration process was smooth, with facilities and restaurants fully explained to us. Still, I often wonder why a lot of hotels have yet to fully embrace contactless registration. Our physical identification card still had to be presented, but surely; the e-identification card should suffice nowadays. Given the hotel’s octagonal shape, I was not surprised at the odd configuration of our room, #2402. It was pleasantly spacious and the placement of furniture took advantage of that.

Singapore Marriott Tang Plaza Hotel,Disgusting and deplorable,"The worst experience of my life. After requesting for an early check in, they told us to book a room for an extra night.

So the showers did not have boundaries for water. The door opened and shut only with a button. The button that said “Door” opened the main door of the room when I was stark naked and going for a bath. The bathroom opened with a button that said “Press”. Great thinking.

My flight landed around 6 am and I reached the hotel around 7:10 am. My flight was terrible and super turbulent, I was travelling with my mother who is an insulin dependent diabetic senior citizen and she just wanted to get some rest.

Singapore Marriott Tang Plaza Hotel,Very poor service in the cafe,"Very poor service in the lobby cafe. Inattentionate, unfriendly. You have to go to the counter every time you want something. The prices are far too high given this kind of service. I mentioned this to the waitress she clearly did not care. This place is to be avoided, I will not come again.",1 out of 5,July 2023,5.0 of 5 stars,#80 of 373 hotels in Singapore,0.088,0.7206666666666666,54.400000000000006,72.06666666666666,8.799999999999999,Services

Singapore Marriott Tang Plaza Hotel,Great stay,"First time in Singapore. We had two rooms. We wanted something centrally located with transport and restaurants around. This hotel hits the mark. Staff were good. Lounge is where the hotel really shines. Amazing staff in there. Great pool. Comfy bed. Room AC worked very well, but the halls and elevators were quite warm.
