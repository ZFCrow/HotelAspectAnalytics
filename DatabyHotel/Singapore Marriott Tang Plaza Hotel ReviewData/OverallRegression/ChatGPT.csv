Suggestions for improvement

Cleaniness: Cleanliness can be improved by making sure all areas of the hotel are kept clean on a regular basis, such as public areas, bathrooms, and guest rooms. Routine inspection and maintenance can also help ensure that all areas remain clean.

Amenities: Improving amenities can be done by offering more types of amenities, such as a pool or gym, or offering more features and upgrades. This could include upgraded bedding, bathrobes, and other luxury amenities.

Location: Improving location could include moving the hotel to a more desirable area or finding ways to make the current location more desirable. For example, adding attractions near the hotel or improving nearby public transportation could help increase the hotel's desirability.

Services: Improving services can be done by having more consistent customer service and ensuring that all staff are properly trained to provide quality service. This could include offering more personalized service or having a more efficient process for check-in and checkout.

General: Improving the general sentiment could be done by offering more value-added services, such as discounts for certain services, free wifi, or a loyalty program. Improving the overall customer experience with more attention to detail can also improve the general sentiment."
