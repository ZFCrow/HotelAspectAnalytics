ibis Singapore on Bencoolen Hotel,"Small Clean Room, and close to Bugis MRT(Train).","It's not a 5 star hotel but it never says it is. It's a good budget hotel, the room was very small but it was clean and had all I needed, a good shower, comfortable bed, airconditioned, a small fridge and TV. Good free internet. My room was on the 13th floor and I had a town view. It cost me $150 Singapore dollars per night. There is no pool. IBIS Bencoolen is close to Bugis MRT station, about a 10 minute walk through the busy Bugis market place.

ibis Singapore on Bencoolen Hotel,Pleasent hotel for few days of stay,The location hotel is good. It's around 400 mts from Bencoolen MRT station. The check-in process was a breeze as it got finished in 5 mins. Need to note here that I had checked in online before. I stayed for 4 nights here and the rooms are pretty compact which is typical of Singapore but they are very clean and welcoming. Housekeeping is up to the mark. They have a restaurant which has buffet breakfast option in the morning. Buffet has plenty of options to cater for everyone's need. Although I would love to see more vegetarian platter.

Best location near Bugis & Bencoolen MRT stations (walk 5mins) & a few bus stops right at the hotel. Connects you to the airport & everywhere else easily!

ibis Singapore on Bencoolen Hotel,World's smallest rooms?,"My comparable room in Bangkok was three times the size but only one third the price. New, and super clean. Quiet, except for hallway noise. No staff in the lobby at all except busy check-in people. No maps of the immediate area, but there were maps of the whole city. I chose this hotel partly because other reviewers mentioned the 6 vegetarian restaurants in the building next door. Sadly, they serve only unidentifiable Chinese stuff, and there is no one at any of them available to explain what anything is. We found a little Western food in the area, and two Thai places a block down to the left and across the street. The restaurant in the hotel featured ""Local Chinese Favorites"" which is insane because there are 100 restaurants nearby serving those wretched favorites.

ibis Singapore on Bencoolen Hotel,"room a bit small, breakfast so so","We checked in for a weekend stay in Singapore at this hotel. The location is nice, close to the Bencoolen MRT station. Take Exit A, turn right, and walk a bit ahead. The lobby is spacious and has plenty of lounging space. There are quite a number of other hotels in the area. The room, however, is a bit too small. The shower is weak. It's better if the breakfast menu focusses only on a few dishes but go deeper. It has western, Japanese, local, and other dishes but each doesn't have adequate varieties.

Tips: I always take seat closer to the outer glass wall for brighter and higher ceiling.

Ibis on Bencoolen was the choice for me. While the room is small which is expected, it is reasonably priced and the room comes with amenities that was good enough to make me feel comfortable. The curtails effectively block out any light coming from outside which makes it very conducive for sleeping. However, the only down sides were that the bed was not exactly comfortable and the TV is too small. Also, the lifts are old and slow which makes the waiting time long and the lift crowded at peak hours.

So near the Albert Mall and many areas for shopping. A mere walking distance away from the Singapore Art Museum and Chijmes area. However, the best thing about staying here is the food choices that you can get. Its so near the Albert Food Centre which offers a wide range of delicious hawker food, from Mee Pok to Popiahs to delicious Yong Tau Foo. If you are not into hawker food, there are plenty of restaurants nearby. I would recommend the Curious Palette and Artichoke Cafe which are all walking distance.

Rooms are small but have all the essentials and are clean and compact. We purchased the bed and breakfast option and the breakfast has sufficient western and Asian variety. If you are staying multiple nights you might find the items repetitive but this is breakfast after all. The best part about the Obis is it’s staff - they are warm and have the right attitude to service. We arrived 3 hrs before check in time and were given rooms within minutes of arrival.
