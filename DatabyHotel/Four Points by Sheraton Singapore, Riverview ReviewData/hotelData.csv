"Four Points by Sheraton Singapore, Riverview",Double thumbs up!!,I stayed in this hotel as a solo traveller and loved the place! Check in was fast and my room was impeccably clean and just the right size for 1-2 people. Easy to get Uber since area is accessible. The staff were all friendly and accomodating. Breakfast has a good spread of food and I enjoyed dining in the outside seating area. When u cross the bridge om the other side you will see a lot of restaurants and cafes. I did a morning walk (it was quite raiming at that time) and find the environment around is lively and caters to foreigners in the area. It's quite peaceful in the evening too to walk around. Check out was fast and efficient and they gave me a late check out as I need to go to our office in the morning and head to the airport after. Totally enjoyed my stay and will be,5 out of 5,March 2023,4.0 of 5 stars,#77 of 372 hotels in Singapore,0.2807104660045837,0.5275910364145657,64.03552330022919,52.759103641456576,28.07104660045837,Location
"Four Points by Sheraton Singapore, Riverview",Hotel long-term living experience,"The breakfast chef Kalvin is very kind and greets us warmly every time, also we like his seafood fried noodles with chicken satay. The rooms are clean and the house keepers are nice, but some rooms have a bathroom sewer smell or the toilet flush is weak. But overall I'm satisfied.",5 out of 5,May 2023,4.0 of 5 stars,#77 of 372 hotels in Singapore,0.20425925925925925,0.6527777777777778,60.21296296296297,65.27777777777779,20.425925925925924,Cleaniness
"Four Points by Sheraton Singapore, Riverview",Next to the river,This hotel is situated next to the river and has a lot of different restaurants near by. The hotel has also at least three different restaurants but personally I only tried one. During my stay the hotel was quite busy and there was very little information given about available facilities etc. It was also a bit strange that the main restaurant suddenly closed for lunch without any reason given. The room was ok but also pricy even without breakfast.,4 out of 5,June 2023,4.0 of 5 stars,#77 of 372 hotels in Singapore,0.04407051282051282,0.4179487179487179,52.203525641025635,41.79487179487179,4.407051282051282,Location
"Four Points by Sheraton Singapore, Riverview",Usual nice Marriott experience!,"It was as expected - the standard, usual Marriott experience which is why I am committed to this company. Big majority of staff are friendly and always willing to help (so far I have had just one not-so-good incidence - not at this property - in my 25+ history with Marriott). Cleanliness, ambience, decor, service, overall quality is always appreciable - almost impeccable. Staff response to loyal member could be better, but I can live with it!",5 out of 5,June 2023,4.0 of 5 stars,#77 of 372 hotels in Singapore,0.17739898989898992,0.46527777777777773,58.869949494949495,46.52777777777777,17.739898989898993,Services
"Four Points by Sheraton Singapore, Riverview",Nice Hotel,"I only got to spend 1 night here on a business trip. The staff were extremely friendly. I needed to check in early and check out early so it was an odd kind of stay, but they managed to accommodate me, which I greatly appreciated because of my crazy travel schedule. The breakfast was excellent. I think the selection was above many other places and the quality of the dishes was delicious. The room was exactly as shown in the pictures. I was comfortable and able to get the rest needed. There was an MRT station just a block away and everything was easy to get to. The riverwalk area is nice. I just wish I had more time to explore.",5 out of 5,July 2023,4.0 of 5 stars,#77 of 372 hotels in Singapore,0.2982456140350877,0.5912280701754387,64.91228070175438,59.12280701754386,29.82456140350877,Services
"Four Points by Sheraton Singapore, Riverview",Great Stay - Clean Rooms & Attentive Staff,"My husband and I stayed at the Four Points Sheraton Singapore for a few days while visiting Singapore, and we had a great experience! The rooms were extremely clean, the staff was very helpful and accommodating, and there were plenty of amenities. The hotel houses 3 restaurants, but it's also near a very bustling area of restaurants behind the hotel. We had a lot of fun walking up the river and seeing many great places to eat/drink. Special shout-out to Jean at the front desk who remembered that we were celebrating a very early babymoon and sent us a cheesecake to the room to celebrate. That attention to detail was very much appreciated. The hotel is also about a 5-7 minute walk to the nearest train station, which made getting around VERY simple. Would definitely stay here",5 out of 5,August 2023,4.0 of 5 stars,#77 of 372 hotels in Singapore,0.2369206349206349,0.4483809523809523,61.84603174603175,44.838095238095235,23.69206349206349,Services
