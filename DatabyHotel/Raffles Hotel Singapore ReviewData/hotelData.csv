Raffles Hotel Singapore,LIANA AT THE RAFFLES HOTEL GIFT SHOP WAS OUTSTANDING! HIGH KUDOS AND THANK YOU FROM A GRATEFUL OVERSEAS SINGAPOREAN,"Aloha from Hawaii! This review has been a long time coming and high kudos to Liana at the Raffles Hotel Gift Shop from a grateful shopper. Liana had the most professional demeanor and helped me acquire over 15 Raffles Polo Shirts, T-Shirts, and more iconic logo accessories for gifting this Christmas here in Hawaii. Liana's exceptional service was evident from the outset when I first asked her for assistance. She made wonderful suggestions and made my shopping experience seamless! Her packing for brilliant too! As a returning overseas Singaporean living in Honolulu, Hawaii, I obviously overbought but was extremely delighted with my purchases. I ended up with my multiple large shopping bags of goodies, and was well satisfied, thanks to Liana.

It was a little overwhelming at first as I was alone and 2 staff attended to me immediately. I think one of your staff mentioned a photograph to be taken but I mentioned that my friend was only joining me later, which I think this part was left out totally thereafter. As this was my first time at raffles, I wasn't sure what exactly was the purpose of the photograph at the start and if I should have follow up with someone.

Raffles Hotel Singapore,Beautiful Grand Old Dame,"I spent 3 nights there. The State Room Suite is nice and comfortable, with a decent sized bathroom. Check in was done prior online, so we were taken to the room almost immediately by the concierge after we arrived. They allowed early check in and late check out, so that was nice. The rooftop pool was lovely for relaxing, and the hotel grounds are lovely for a stroll. The history tour was excellent, and Roslee did a great job of showing us the hotel and its displays. However, some lapses in service and procedures were disappointing. A few times, my orders for breakfast were wrong. My bookings were made under 2 reservations, which I requested to be linked.

The high tea set looks pretty and very instagram worthy. I preferred the savory snacks which tasted really good as compared to the sweet selections, I find them a tad too sweet for my liking. Perhaps more raspberry options to the pink theme would be good to even out the sweets, personal preference as I don't really have a sweet tooth and the taste of the 'pink' snacks seemed pretty similar after a while. If you are going with some friends, would probably be a good idea to order a mix of the traditional high tea and sakura high tea sets for a mix to share.

The decor is elegant and classy colonial, the clientele deliciously eclectic but the Singapore Slings taste the same as they always have. If you ask nicely at the bar, they will even let you operate the old mechanical English made Sling cocktail shaker machine. Be warned, you need strong arm muscles!

Raffles Hotel Singapore,"Disappointeds with afternoon tea, maybe expectations a bit high.","On previous two visits to Singapore we have had afternoon tea at Raffles as a special to ourselves. So after 5 weeks of visiting relations in the UK we decided to spoil ourselves again. The staff were very welcoming, and efficient without being overbearing. What was disappointing was the amount of food and that you had to pay extra for a drink. At 80+ dollars a head its a bit steep. There was minimal hot food - two scones each-. Where were the sausage rolls, small pies, samosa etc? The sandwiches and cakes were nice but didn't really satisfy our hunger. As a comparison the Hyatt in Canberra does a great afternoon high tea and it would be good for the F & B Mamager to visit and see what they do for a lesser price. But we did enjoy ourselves and thank you to the staff and harpist",5 out of 5,October 2022,5.0 of 5 stars,#19 of 372 hotels in Singapore,0.17003174603174603,0.5185396825396825,58.5015873015873,51.853968253968254,17.003174603174603,Value

The food and beverage offer is so well curated and offers great variety and choice.

We had comfortable sofa and chair seating in the Grand Lobby location that was surprisingly quiet and the accompanying music by a harpist was enjoyable. But as a lover of afternoon tea this experience could be improved. There is a very limited selection of teas to choose from and Raffles uses tea bags not leaves! And for the size of pot there should have been 2 tea bags but there was only one. My Earl Grey tea was weak and tasteless and the addition of a second tea bag didn’t improve this. The sandwiches, cakes and scones were all delicious but like the use of a single tea bag, the portions were tiny.

We were having the standard afternoon tea. One with Ceylon black tea and I was having the house ground coffee. After 30 mins a tea pot for 2 arrived plus one coffee. This was fine until we found that only 1 tea bag had been used for the 2 person pot. We also pointed out that no milk had been provided. 2 teabags were in the 2nd teapot when it arrived but still no milk And by the way no tiered tray of sandwiches had arrived either. A waiter did try to serve scones jam and clotted cream but we pointed out that we would prefer them after sandwiches etc My partner got very upset having expected a fabulous experience for the event that she had looked forward to,2 out of 5,November 2022,5.0 of 5 stars,#19 of 372 hotels in Singapore,0.08600000000000001,0.45733333333333326,54.300000000000004,45.73333333333333,8.600000000000001,Services

Raffles Hotel Singapore,An Old British Oasis In a Very Modern City,"This is a bit of old British luxury in the heart of a bustling modern city. Staff, food, accommodations and service were excellent and everyone worked so hard to receive that rating -- so it is a shame that the owner of Raffles, the Accor hotel group, badly marred our experience with a terrible fumble at the outset. Upon check-in, we were notified that our reservation had been canceled by Accor's computer system. According to Raffles staff, the computer system just arbitrarily and on its own made the decision to cancel us -- which evoked images of HAL in 2001: A Space Odyssey saying in response to our desire to check in: ""I'm sorry Dave, but I cannot do that."" While staff gave us a ""gee, I'm sorry about that"" apology, we were nonetheless justifiably irritated by the",4 out of 5,December 2022,5.0 of 5 stars,#19 of 372 hotels in Singapore,-0.10833333333333331,0.6643939393939393,44.583333333333336,66.43939393939394,10.83333333333333,Services

I'll make a special call out for the service which was exemplary, practically everywhere and on all accounts. If you're considering a stay at the Raffles don't hesitate, do it.

Raffles Hotel Singapore,A simply fantastic experience!,"Our stay at Raffles was all that we hoped it would be. Our suite was luxurious, particularly the bathroom with its inlaid marble floor which was absolutely stunning. No attention to detail had been spared - there was even a pillow for the bath. The staff were all so friendly and made us feel very welcome. Particular mention should be given to Roslee Sukar, the hotel's resident historian, who took us on a guided tour of the hotel. Roslee's enthusiasm for Raffles shone through and we would recommend anyone staying at Raffles to take the tour with Roslee. Our suite came with its own butlers, Reena and Thyra, who left me a lovely card, balloons and a little birthday cake for my birthday which was a lovely touch. The breakfast buffet was excellent.

Room was ready at check-in (at 9am!) and we were upgraded from a Courtyard Suite to a Palm Court Suite. Bags were delivered promptly and our butler gave us a sit-down to explain the room workings, etc. We casually mentioned wanting to ""drop in"" at the Long Bar later in the evening and he highly recommended allowing him to secure a reservation for us.

Raffles Hotel Singapore,"Ignore elastic Singapore, the destination is Raffles Hotel!",The renovation is invisible yet obvious everywhere. The Charlie Chaplin Suite is the last on a wing and without even a whisper from a passbyer. Management is invisible because the staff is flawless. This is the most interesting hotel in the world as everything glides through space without friction or guile. The personality of the property is sophificated yet not intrusive or overbearing. Every angle of the space is one of infinity overhead due to towering ceilings and open air. The color of the offwhite motiff absorbs light and creates a lofty mood of wellbeing. The indoor and outdoor spaces flow into each other as if by magic or irony. Raffles Hotel Singapore is living art because the focus is exceeding guest expectations without fanefare or fakery.

Welcomed at the airport, escorted to a waiting Mercedes then seamless transfer to the hotel and suite. Had little need for a butler but was there if needed.

Service was generally indifferent and we were unable to make a reservation at any of the better restaurants - despite being residents - and simply told ""sorry we are fully booked"" We found the whole experience to be generally unacceptable for a hotel that is positioning itself at this level and charging accordingly.

Raffles Hotel Singapore,Not quite there yet,I am conflicted to write this review as there are some great positives. But the negatives started to get at me. We stayed in the hotel for 2 nights and had a state room which was absolutely gorgeous. One of the best in the world. The hotel is beautiful and well refurbished after being only reopened for 6 months. Apart from that the hotel has issues and maybe it’s due to the short re opening and the staff need more training. Overall the staff lack 5 star service. There are other hotels in Singapore that offer better more knowledgeable service. The concierge only knew about 5 restaurants between the 4 of them and they were all big hotel restaurants. The pool staff were completely inattentive. No real service and if you want a pool hotel this is not it. Very small for a 150 room,4 out of 5,December 2019,5.0 of 5 stars,#19 of 372 hotels in Singapore,0.2514705882352941,0.5188235294117647,62.5735294117647,51.88235294117647,25.147058823529413,General

Raffles Hotel Singapore,Stunning place to stay,For many years both my wife and I have had many trips to Singapore but never together - we always vowed when we did we would stay at Raffles - regrettably it was being refurbished a couple of years ago so finally in January we made it - and it was worth the wait. Before we had even arrived our butler had made contact to ensure all the details were correct and that they knew our inbound flight details. On arrival you feel really special - as a guest you are made to feel like the most important person that any of the staff have dealt with that day. I never found a single member of staff who didn't exemplify the Raffles standards. Treat yourself to afternoon tea - it really is sublime. I thought we Brits did afternoon tea - but Raffles shows how it is really done.

Raffles Hotel Singapore,"Service great, product falls short",This iconic hotel is beautiful - no mistake. However I do feel that the management have set themselves up to be critiqued on everything - they set the tone that nothing is too much trouble and the butler service amplifies this. The people are great - there would be no one I would criticise. However there were one or two issues which detracted from my stay: 1) the rooms above me were not adequately sound proofed - at times it sounded like a herd of elephants were above me. The management say the rooms are sound proofed - have they actually tested this themselves? 2) my shower head had clearly been previously dropped and was leaking from the rim.

Raffles Hotel Singapore,Lives up to its reputation!,"Raffles is without a doubt a stunningly beautiful hotel offering brilliant customer service and amenities for its guests. If you can afford to visit then It’s a bucket list thing. However, there were a few nit picky things that were slightly disappointing and this is only given the price that you pay for a room. The ceilings are thin - meaning that you can hear every single footsteps above you making for a restless sleep. Additionally they did not provide an iron or any milk which are basic amenities for a hotel room and I understand this is because they want to make money from the ironing service but very inconvenient if you just wish to iron something quickly.

Raffles Hotel Singapore,Appalling service...for a Raffles.,"It once was, but it no longer is. The renovation is just lipstick on a pig. Even thought this Property was not a pig in its glory days. The staff, is snobbish and unbecoming the service and expectations of a Raffles property.

Raffles Hotel Singapore,Can't quite put my finger on it but.......,"From a tangible and practical point of view, it is almost impossible to fault Raffles. The one issue that we did have on the first morning regarding gluten free meal breakfast was quickly resolved by the end of the following day. What seems to be missing is the relaxed ambience that some of the best hotels in the world manage to achieve, whilst still having the same very high standards. Part of the reason for this might be the uneasy tension between the privacy of the hotel guests and the unusually large number of non resident visitors in whose selfies you might find yourself appearing . For example opening our bedroom door and right outside on the other side of the railings were people taking selfies of themselves, and having to swiftly close the door and get out of the way.",4 out of 5,February 2020,5.0 of 5 stars,#19 of 372 hotels in Singapore,0.13074358974358974,0.4076630036630036,56.537179487179486,40.766300366300364,13.074358974358974,General

There were a series of disappointments, which individually were minor issues, but which cumulatively added up over a day, was frustrating because of the expectations we had for the Grande Dame. Thankfully, on the second day, we were shown that the core team was a good one that continued to demonstrate strong service culture, and so we have faith that these operational issues can be easily rectified. I would like to show my appreciation first and foremost to Keith, for his very swift response when we finally decided we could not hold back our thoughts any longer.

Raffles Hotel Singapore,The Iconic Raffles that did not meet expectations.,"--Summary-- Our stay at Raffles would be something I would call… a hit and miss scenario. There were indeed areas where the hotel met or exceeded my expectations but also areas where it was pure disappointment. To keep it simple, Raffles Singapore clearly has one of the best hard products (Suites and Amenities) on offer in Singapore. The Suites are just superb and extraordinary. The restorations of Raffles that happen last year did the hotel well as it truly is a flagship hotel now. However, the soft products (Service and tangible touches) leaves much to be desired. Yes, there were some staff who took great care of us, but also there were some staff who did not bother either.

Raffles Hotel Singapore,Simply the best,"Having stayed at most of the luxury hotels in Singapore, Raffles Hotel remains one the last hotels we have yet to try, and we were so glad we saved the very best for the last. From the moment of stepping in, we knew it was going to be a very special stay. There is something very charming and magical about staying at Raffles, which has been wonderfully restored and injected with a dose of modern classiness that appealed very much to our modern sensibilities, and yet the old-world charm that it continues to exude triggers a curious yet tantalising feeling of being lost in time and space; a very much welcomed feeling of escapism indeed. Our favorite part of the stay was probably the breakfast. Breakfast, while lacking in variety, was impeccable in terms of quality.

Booking a getaway at a property of this caliber is a treat. When packages go missing, phones go unanswered, food delayed, birthdays unremarked and questions left unresolved, the build up of disappointments overwhelms the beauty of the place.

The Raffles Hotel has topped all our expectations. An iconic building in Singapore with a long history. The hotel gives a rustic colonial feeling at the same time the new owners have restored it to provide all the modern amenities a traveller would require and more. Rooms are large and comfortable. Very well thought out amenities. From something as simple as the hot water mixer is set in a way that you would never end up scaling yourself. The way the master switch works with the night lights makes it all so convenient to use and switch off the lights in the room and yet have lights in the toilet on in case one needs a late night visit.

It was my 3 days 2 nights stay at this beautifully renovated hotel.

Raffles Hotel Singapore,Magical Time Capsule,"We stayed at the Raffles as a family, three of us - staycation - and loved it. Surprisingly, we are as relaxed as if we had actually travelled somewhere. And in a way we did. The Raffles Singapore is a universe onto itself, even more fabulous after the recent renovation. It feels like stepping back in time, certainly like stepping out of Singapore which after a long time of not being able to travel anywhere was sorely needed. History is everywhere in the Raffles - well worth participating in the history tour by the lovely local historian who has a lot of stories and little details one would otherwise never know.

Check In – We were escorted to our room for an in-room check in and were asked for our IDs (which I thought was weird as we had already furnished it during the online registration). Nothing else was required from us after that and we were asked if it was appropriate for our butler to come by and walk us through the room features.

Quite senseless to be honest, one phone call and isnt it quicker? As such a simple teaspoon went around the moon and back, and other countless things.
