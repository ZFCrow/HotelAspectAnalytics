"PARKROYAL COLLECTION Pickering, Singapore",Efficient system and staff.,"Stayed for 3D2N to celebrate our son's 1st birthday. Check in was a breeze, facility booking via qr code was definitely an upgraded system from other hotels that we have stayed at. Kudos for this innovation! Hotel was comfortably quiet especially with the greeneries cushioning the city and road noise. Ms Amy from Lime restaurant was the highlight of our stay as she took the initiative to get personal with our baby to constantly check if he is fine and requires additional assistance (over anything at all). She deserves a commendation for the extra mile she took in the line of customer service.

"PARKROYAL COLLECTION Pickering, Singapore",Chinatown Green Hotel,I love this hotel because it is strategically located right in front of Hong Lim Green. It is also opposite the Hong Lim Food Market which has famous local food. You can also roam around Chinatown and check out all the streets. Hotel itself has plenty of greenery although it is an urban style hotel. The pool and surroundings really look different from other urban style hotels. Always make sure you get a room facing the hong lim park rather than looking into all the shophouse roofs.

Really enjoyed the aesthetics and design of both the hotel and the room which came with a great view of the city. Having a hotel situated within the CBD really allowed for us to travel to many good dining spots easily. Hotel staff were also wonderful and helpful by allowing us to extend our checkout by an hour. However, We faced an issue with the cleaning crew. While I was changing in the room, the cleaning crew just opened the door and came into our room unexpectedly! Luckily it was me and not my wife changing. They apologised and mentioned that it was stated on their app that we had already checked out.

"PARKROYAL COLLECTION Pickering, Singapore",More Hits than Misses,"Stayed here for the first time over the weekend and reserved the Collection Lifestyle Room. Check-in was on a Saturday and for guests driving to the hotel, do take note of the following. When I entered the hotel car park, it shows it still has many lots available, but in actual fact, the car park was full. I drove down to the lobby and was told that I could park at any available space, not obstructing traffic. As with a Saturday, long queues are expected during check-in, but there is no differentiated queue for guests of club rooms. At 3pm, my room wasn't ready, hence we were given a temporary access card to the Club Lounge on level 16 for the afternoon tea.

From the first day, I was given the strong impression that with the recent change in manpower all over the hotel and the large amount of experienced staff that left; the service standards of the hotel is in shambles.

I booked this hotel via Luxury Escapes on the spur of the moment. It was time to start travelling again and we really needed a break from the pandemic situation of the last two years. Having never holidayed in Singapore before it turned out to be a perfect base to get a newcomers feel of the city. This hotel is perfectly positioned between the Clarke Quay and Chinatown MTR stations so getting around is easy. Our room was perfect and didn't lack anything.

We opted for the Collection Club room which enabled our access to the Club Lounge. The room we had was well appointed with all amenities and a lovely view of the front of the hotel (we were on the 13th floor in a wing room) and Clarke Quay. The general location of the hotel was good. On the edge of Chinatown and within a five minute walk of Clarke Quay and Boat Quay. We used the MRT for almost all of our travel and there were two MRT stations (Clarke Quay and Chinatown) within 150m. But for us, the outstanding feature of the hotel was the access to the Lounge.

Gone are the days when as a guest you would be waited on, now you have to ask for everything assuming you can speak to them while they aren’t on their phones.

"PARKROYAL COLLECTION Pickering, Singapore",Overpriced hotel with small rooms and unreliable service especially during peak times.,"I was recommended this hotel by a friend for my first stay in Singapore. The room I reserved, an ‘urban deluxe’ or whatever it was, lacked a portable refrigerator usually provided in most basic hotels. The room was much smaller than I expected - the size of a college dormitory. It’s so small that the bathroom has no separate wall. Instead there are two sliding doors, one from the entrance and one from the bed area that must be pulled to meet together to seal off the bathroom for privacy. The bathroom sink has a small filtered water dispenser from which you get your drinking water - No bottles of mineral water provided like in normal motels! There’s no way to chill the water since there’s no refrigerator. You have to call the front desk to request an ice bucket.

First I would say that the service felt rushed and lacked friendliness thruout the hotel. Even at club lounge you had to ask things several times before delivered. Pool are full of dirty towels all day. The room had plenty of issues, stained carpets, no shampoo, leaking pipes. Everything that looks wood, it’s actually plastic (everywhere in the hotel). Also the electric curtains made a lot of sound, so you would wake up every morning if your neighbours would move the curtains. Pool are very small for this size of s hotel.

We arrived and had no help with our luggage from the awaiting member of staff. We are happy and able to move our own belongings but it was not the 5* service. Checking in was no problem. The room is good and we had a lifestyle Premier room. The pool and gym facilities are good. The bar man in Limes bar was hugely influential for us and gave us some great recommendations.

"PARKROYAL COLLECTION Pickering, Singapore",Event at ParkRoyal Collection Pickering,"During roadshow in early year 2022, we were served by Valent (sales director) and after signing the package, we were assigned to Josco (wedding coordinator), we experienced a hard time communicating with them. There are a lot of discrepancies between Valent and Josco words. It seemed to us that the hotel do not have a standardised rules and regulation. Whatever Valent promised and agreed wasn't conveyed to Josco. At that point of time, we felt unfairly treated because it seemed to us that Valent is only doing his job as a salesperson and nothing more, when the sales is ""closed"", he simply ""throw"" everything to Josco and did not relay the agreement to Josco.

Overall, we are very pleased with our experience and we are so glad that we chose to go with PRP for this once-in-a-lifetime occasion.",5 out of 5,September 2023,5.0 of 5 stars,#29 of 372 hotels in Singapore,0.24640692640692644,0.568031968031968,62.32034632034632,56.8031968031968,24.640692640692645,Services
"PARKROYAL COLLECTION Pickering, Singapore",An enjoyable relaxing weekend with my family!,"We had an enjoyable weekend and we were truly impressed with Hui Wen from Front Desk. How she handled our request for upgrading with professionalism and always with a smile. She also went the extra mile by checking and updating us on the availability of the rooms. Uncle Ang, the housekeeper who came up with the items was all smiles and even made sure we had what we requested and even made sure that the message was passed over to his other colleagues. After which we made our way to the Collection Club Lounge. Over there we made our acquaintance with Ana. She was so sweet and recommended drinks for myself and my family. I think overall we were bought over with their smiles and friendliness. The staff really made our stay there welcomed and we would love to go back and stay with",5 out of 5,September 2023,5.0 of 5 stars,#29 of 372 hotels in Singapore,0.3104166666666667,0.45023148148148145,65.52083333333334,45.023148148148145,31.041666666666668,Services
"PARKROYAL COLLECTION Pickering, Singapore","Great hotel, great stay","It’s the first time visit to this hotel and won’t be the last. We were greeted by the manager as a Platinum level member and escorted to our room. The room was very spacious, clean and the view exceptional. We had afternoon tea in the club lounge which was very good. Evening cocktails and finger food in club lounge was again excellent. The staff were amazing, unfortunately I do not know the names of the two Philippines ladies that served us (Monday 18 September) they went way beyond their duties and made us feel so welcome. Big thanks to them to teach us to do selfies and groupies😁. We will without doubt return to this hotel on our next visit to Singapore. Once again warm thanks to all the staff.
