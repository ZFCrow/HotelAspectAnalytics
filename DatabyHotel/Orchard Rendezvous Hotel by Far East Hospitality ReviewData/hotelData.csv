Orchard Rendezvous Hotel by Far East Hospitality,One of the better staycation we ever had!,"We have been greeted by many warm & friendly staff throughout our 3 day stay. Staff Liya & Samy were exceptionally pleasant & patient in making our stay a memorable one.from the time we checked in to serving us at the breakfast table.

Orchard Rendezvous Hotel by Far East Hospitality,Cigarette smell delayed my sleeping time,"My family and I stayed from 13 Feb to 25 Feb 2022.

I opened the balcony door and called the front desk to inform about this. The front desk said they will try to investigate and soon the smell disappeared. But then several hours later, the smell came back. This time I did not inform the front desk because I was honestly lazy. So I just opened the balcony again until the smell totally disappeared. However at around 11pm, just when I was about the sleep, the cigarette smell came again really strong. So I called the front desk. Up to this point, I was seriously annoyed.

Orchard Rendezvous Hotel by Far East Hospitality,Last time I'm staying here...,"So I'm all for hotels taking an environmental stance, but when this stance is imposed on the guest then it's hard to see it as anything less than a margin grab. No bottled water in the room - just a sign saying 'Singapore water is great so drink that and be happy'. Now I know the water is good quality in SG, but the pipes at this 50 yr old hotel and the cleanliness of the glasses in the room etc, these are a complete gamble. Sure enough the water tastes steely. So I ring Room Service (at 9:30pm) and nobody answers. So then I try front desk and I'm finally told that the hotel doesn't sell water. (But it does sell Coke, Sprite, Beer etc which are 95%....yep, water) I would have gone down to the bar, but when I walked past at 9pm it was closed. Great.

It's right next to the Hard Rock Cafe, so you can hear the music at night, but it didn't bother me that much. I will definitely use it next time. We look forward to seeing you next time.

The bathrooms need a refurb anyway. Lots of cracked tiles and black mould on ledges. I would suggest people find someone else to stay.

Orchard Rendezvous Hotel by Far East Hospitality,Look for a better option,I have stayed at this hotel multiple times before when it was called orchard parade. The hotel and the management has changed drastically. We were there 3 days. The breakfast is v sad. Its american breakfast not buffet which they used to have earlier. There is not a single sofa or a chair at the reception to even sit down one has to go sit at their bar. I have never seen any hotel in the entire world which does not have a seating arrangement in the lobby. We had to change our rooms thrice because of poor views and space. The rooms dont have any complimentary water bottles. You are encouraged to drink water from the tap or buy you own. The location is the only saving grace about this hotel now.

Also the dining room is freezing cold. Didn't bother with breakfast on the third day. Tea in the pot was cold. No teabags to make your own, you would have to bring one from your room?

Do drive carefully into the car park though, as there are sharp 90 degree turns and also lots are somewhat narrow. We got to the hotel right when many guests were checking in at around 2:15PM-ish, so the not especially spacious reception area felt a little crowded.

Upon check-in we were attended by Liya, the awesome hotel staff, who happened to also be working at the Club Lounge during the evening cocktails on that day. Check-in was seamless, rooms were impeccably clean, evening cocktails were awesome. Liya and Diana provided us with really good and warm service. My friends and I were very happy with our stay at this hotel. The only little disappointment was the breakfast, which wasn‚Äôt up to expectations (Nasi Lemak) coz it was catered by an external caterer. This hotel doesn‚Äôt have an in-house kitchen.
