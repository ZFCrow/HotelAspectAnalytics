The staff were friendly and helpful, pointing me in the direction of the area's many attractions and fabulous hawker stands. Definitely check out the Amoy Street Hawker centre, its a local favorite, but try not to go during lunch time, it gets very crowded! Everything in Chinatown was easily walkable and the hotel is situated right next to an MRT stop for easy travel to anywhere one may want to do.

Personally, I believe if you want to try a Chinese-style hotel, you should choose here. Otherwise, you might have other options. The main entrance is like to temple from ancient China. Well, it is a building from a long time ago. You need to go into the temple, then to the right-hand side, where you will see a small gate leading you to the hotel's front desk. The hotel has a back door, too, which absolutely will let you know this is a hotel. The corridor decoration is full of last names in Chinese, which is pretty interesting, even though I am viewing it from a Chinese point of view. However, the room itself is small, which reminds me of the size of the hotel room in Tokyo. Maybe it is normal as it is downtown Singapore.

AMOY Hotel by Far East Hospitality,Not So Good For Couples ?,"I stayed with my wife at Amoy Hotel for 4 nights in February - this being our first visit to Singapore after travelling in Thailand. The main attraction of the hotel is its convenient central location on the edge of Chinatown opposite an MRT, and its very friendly/helpful staff. If you get a taxi transfer from the airport, direct the driver to Telok Ayer MRT Exit B - otherwise, you may get dropped off somewhere nearby (as we were) and wonder where you are. The downside of the hotel, in my experience, is the size and design of the rooms. We stayed in a split-level Deluxe King Bedroom that was simply too small and lacking in storage space.

Thomas helped me multiple times with all my queries and it was a pity I could not say goodbye as he was on leave. Clemence’s lunch recommendation was superb. Didn’t like: I like airy rooms with lots of light and some space and less noise. 1) The rooms – the first room was on the 3rd floor - the width was about 2 ft extra each side of the bed.

AMOY Hotel by Far East Hospitality,Brilliant hotel 😊,"I stayed at the Amoy hotel for 6 nights in one of the deluxe rooms. This is a great hotel to stay in, it is in a good area close to many different restaurants and the Telok Ayer and Raffles Place MRT stations as well as a lot of bus stops. The room was comfortable and clean with everything I needed. It did get quite loud outside as the hotel is near a lot of restaurants, but I found that most of the noise was blocked out, so the room itself didn't have heaps of noise. I found the bed to be comfortable and had more than enough space. The staff at the hotel were really friendly and helpful and would go our of their way to help out with something. Breakfast was at the genius central and was very enjoyable (loved the smoothie bowls) Would highly recommend to stay here 😊",5 out of 5,December 2022,4.0 of 5 stars,#3 of 373 hotels in Singapore,0.3606140350877193,0.5931578947368421,68.03070175438597,59.31578947368421,36.06140350877193,Location

AMOY Hotel by Far East Hospitality,Staycation for my birthday with my wife,I prebooked this trip during the omicron wave early this year when they had the members promotion where u only paid 11 dollar for the 2nd night.

This was extremely good service on Amoy's part as we didn have to lug our things while heading out for lunch. Everything was good from the check in process to the staff friendliness. Very very good service by them. If you face any issues or need help during your stay feel free to ask them and they will be more than welcome to help you.

The room was nice, love the style and layout. The table is a bit on the smaller side however. Combined with the things already there, it made writing a bit difficult. The AC was a bit stubborn, so I had to switch it off from time to time. The bathroom was nice but the water temperature seemed to fluctuate quite a bit.

Check in 2 days prior to my arrival, I received an email from the hotel offering a complimentary pick up from the hotel. The hotel agreed to drop me off at a different location (5-minute away from the hotel). Once I landed, I was picked up on a Mercedes and the experience was smooth and easy. As a business traveler, I very much appreciated this.

Room was always clean and again service was top notch especially all the help/recommendations we got from the front desk. Do yourself a favor and stay here.

We only caught a taxi once - to the airport! The hotel itself is located behind a museum in Chinatown in old shops, which is really interesting, but does mean the rooms are small (but well laid-out). We didn't realise that some are internal (with no windows) however this didn't make a huge difference to us as we were only there to sleep. People wanting an outlook from their room wouldn't like it though.

This small hotel is located in the centre of Raffles Place, which gave me the best logistics convenience; I walked to all the various meeting places which did not take longer than 10 minutes. What is even better is that this place is surrounded by a number of pubs nearby, where you can indulge in some relief after work, but in terms of noise, this place is completely isolated from the sound of pubs. It is also pertinent to note that the ""club street"" where good bars and restaurants are located is just 10 minutes walk's distance.

I had been traveling in SE Asia for 7 weeks, and this was my least favorite out of 14 hotels.

Really?!? They knew when we would arrive due to the airport pickup by the hotel. This was so unacceptable for a hotel to do. They suggested that we wait in their so-called lobby, which was just an alcove off a busy public walkway between two buildings.

AMOY Hotel by Far East Hospitality,A GREAT STAY AT THE AMOY,Our first trip to Singapore and we were staying at the Amoy Hotel Telok Ayer. Our flight arrived late - National Day holiday caused a back log at immigration and we missed our Limo pick up at the airport. Took a chance and thought we would try the MRT - which we managed quite well. The reception apologised profusely and said they had tried to contact me (which was true) but I had removed my SIM to save roaming so had no contact. They assured us that they would return us by Limo to the airport on our outward bound journey. Our room was on the 2nd floor and it overlooked a walkway with a restaurant. To be truthful there were two nights where it became noisy but it didn't last that long and everything else about the hotel and the room we were in compensated for a little noise.,5 out of 5,August 2018,4.0 of 5 stars,#3 of 373 hotels in Singapore,0.0625,0.3388888888888889,53.125,33.88888888888889,6.25,Services

AMOY Hotel by Far East Hospitality,Just awesome!,The hotel is on great location for business travelers as well as for leisure activity. You have 5 min walks to downtown center where most companies have headquarters. Also Marina Bay with all attraction is 5-10 min walk from hotel.

Hotel is situated in old chinese temple so it is very special. Rooms are small ( as in all Singapore) but you have all the things you need including you own free of charge coffee machine and free of charge mini bar. But the best side of hotel is staff.

AMOY Hotel by Far East Hospitality,great stay and experience,"Stayed as a couple May 2018 We chose to come to Singapore to mark our one year wedding anniversary. Location: Location of hotel was very central, opposite metro station which provided great access around Singapore. The breakfast venue was located next door to the hotel and provided a limited but good quality range of items. Hotel: Hotel used to be a former temple and museum (hence the outside facade) and also acts as a walk way for many Singaporeans (which confused us during our stay as we saw people just waltzing straight through the corridor and out the other end!) but it certainly is very well kept and I really like the heritage theme the venue had going throughout. Room: Our hotel room was quiet on a higher floor and clean.

They really have thought of everything. Breakfast at Dean & Deluca was basic but more than sufficient before our days out exploring Singapore.

AMOY Hotel by Far East Hospitality,Business stay,Chose the place for its location near Chinatown and description. Was disappointed to discover public passage right through the lobby. Breakfast had to be taken in an off site place with very poor choice given the price of the room. The Japanese restaurant on site doesn’t allow charges to the room. Poorly marked outside and hard to stop off for cars to pick up guests. Air conditioning very noisy and rooms small for the price charged.

The hotel itself has a great ambiance, and I loved the split-level design of the rooms. Breakfast is done by Dean & Deluca around the corner, which is a really nice touch.

Everything at the Amoy hotel is perfect from the location in the heart of Chinatown, the reception to the room (small but perfectly design) and the warm and personal welcome from each team member. I felt like they knew me even if it was my first time in this hotel. The delicious cocktail at the check-in by the lovely Silvia, the room introduction by the devoted Jeremy was more than an excellent start. Every morning they booked a taxi for me, provide me with a bottle of water and walk me all the way to the taxi, perfect when you know how Singapore could be pouring in a second.

AMOY Hotel by Far East Hospitality,Top notch hospitality,"Beautiful lobby of surnames 👍🏻 Fantastic hospitality with a cooling in-house blend of welcome tea. Adham served us and he spotted via our check-in documents that my wife’s birthday is coming up soon. He immediately went to a cafe and brought to our room a birthday cake and handwritten birthday card. Bumped into Thomas, another concerige who engaged us in a friendly conversation. Overall stay is very pleasant, especially the wonderful thoughtfulness of the team to place a handwritten welcome card. Room and bed etc is clean. Highly recommend the place.",5 out of 5,October 2023,4.0 of 5 stars,#3 of 374 hotels in Singapore,0.5186363636363637,0.7672727272727272,75.93181818181817,76.72727272727272,51.86363636363637,Services
AMOY Hotel by Far East Hospitality,Amoy Hotel Singapore,Wonderful customer service but rooms are not soundproofed and you hear the loud music from neighbouring restaurants and bars. Great location for Chinatown and 2 MRT stations are close. Would request room in different part of hotel if I stayed again.,3 out of 5,September 2023,4.0 of 5 stars,#3 of 374 hotels in Singapore,0.475,0.7875,73.75,78.75,47.5,Amenities
AMOY Hotel by Far East Hospitality,A characteristic hotel,"A comfortable hotel with a museum at the entrance. The room looks like the Japanese ones, the window is on the street below full of restaurants, but it isn’t noisy. The staff is really nice and available to help you in every request. I asked to do a shower before leaving, 5-6 hours after the check out and they allowed me to do it without any problems. For the breakfast you can choose the continental one in a restaurant really near to the hotel at the same street or an Oriental breakfast in the restaurant right next to the hotel. I chose the continental one, the pastries and the cappuccino were delicious!",5 out of 5,September 2023,4.0 of 5 stars,#3 of 374 hotels in Singapore,0.3135714285714285,0.4810714285714285,65.67857142857143,48.10714285714285,31.35714285714285,Cleaniness

AMOY Hotel by Far East Hospitality,It was an awesome 1-night stay at AMOY!,"Positives: - Amazing location, just 2 min walk from Telok Ayer train station Exit B. - Very warm hospitality by the front desk officer & was provided with a welcome drink & macarons, with a hint of chinese vibes (which suited the theme of the hotel very well!). I was brought personally to the room by the front desk officer (something which I've never experienced in any of my travels & staycations)! - Although the lobby feels like it's free-access to the public, you actually need the key card in the lift & to enter the rooms area, which felt more secure too. - I really liked the interior design and layout of the Deluxe room (although I need to highlight it may not be suitable for families with elderly/young children due to the stairs in the room) & it was really spacious!
