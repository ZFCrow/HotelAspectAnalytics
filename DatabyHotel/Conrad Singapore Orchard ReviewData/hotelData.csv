Conrad Singapore Orchard,Great classic with good access to the posh end of Orchard Road,"We were most appreciative of a hotel that could confirm availability of accessible rooms prior to arrival/check-in. A gem that has lasted decades, located at a safe area off Orchard Road that is conveniently located near greenery (near Botanic Gardens) and classy western restaurants at Dempsey Hill and other establishments within walking distance at the posh end of Orchard Road. Great service - courteous and efficient. Parking is complimentary for our hired car and with easy egress and ingress. Loved the pool, gym and sauna - and had very memorable food and drinks by the pool - exceptional service with well trained staff. The weekend high tea looks like a classy British affair, but we couldn't indulge as one amongst us is gluten-intolerant.

Conrad Singapore Orchard,Excellent place to stay,"This is an excellent place to stay, in the city center. Short drives/walking distance from many attractions. Nice reception and good interiors. The rooms are good, well designed and spacious. The best part is the complementary mobile phone in the Room, which you can carry with you while roaming in the city and can make and receive free calls to local and many countries. So no worries, if you are having a phone and worried about international roaming charges. I stayed in this hotel twice and had an excellent experience.

Conrad Singapore Orchard,"Great location, Great food","Rooms: the rooms are a little dingy. The limited lights in the room, make the room very dull & dark. The view from the rooms is also very ordinary. Food: the food spread for any of the meals - breakfast, lunch, dinner, is extraordinary. the number of options, and variety on offer, makes it worth every penny spent. Location: Located on Orchard road, it is in the heart of the shopping district. It is walking distance from the Orchid Gardens, and numerable malls.

Several colleagues mentioned that the Regent was often very well priced and comfortable so I gave it a try when I needed a room. I found it to be a very comfortable hotel with very competitive pricing given its offerings. It is just a short stroll to Tanglin shops and a little further to the end of Orchard Road with the newer, ""tonier"" Malls/shops. Rooms are comfortable and well designed, and the location is relatively quiet. Service was very good.

Conrad Singapore Orchard,One of my favourite stays ....,"I previously stayed at a former Regent hotel in Turks & Caicos and had a great time. When Regent popped up in my search results in Singapore, I had to go for it, especially being a Four Seasons hotel on top of that. Told the checkin, it was for my wife's birthday, we are visiting South East Asia and this is the 5th country on our list. The birthday actually falls during our stay at Singapore. The day of checkin was my wife's birthday, the checkin attendant noticed it when looking at our ID. I asked if possible to do something special and she mentioned she will take care of it. At checkin, I paid extra to get the club lounge access and dedicated rooms. The price was worth it, if you were doing breakfast at the hotel.

Our opinion has not changed in that the service is excellent from the welcome from the doormen, check in staff, cleaners, restaurant staff, etc. How many of them remember our names each time is quite marvellous. We stay in the Executive rooms, as the benefits of a relaxing place for breakfast, afternoon tea, happy hour drinks in the evening, and excellent hot and cold snacks, plus wonderful service from the staff, make the extra cost well worth it.

The complementary smart phones are a great idea; free calls back home made a real difference for me.

Conrad Singapore Orchard,"Adequate large hotel, showing its age","We had a pleasant room for our two-night stay, which was serviced very well. However, the hotel's furnishings are tired and the internal atrium which towers above the ground floor gives it an oppressive feel. Generally the public spaces are quite dark and gloomy. The sombre atmosphere was not improved whilst we were there by the dominance of large groups and cruise passengers. Although there are huge numbers of people to serve, breakfast was good and well organised, if hectic. Just having arrived, we visited the Italian restaurant.

Added bonus - Rooms come equipped with a HANDY smartphone to use while visiting so you really don't need to add an international plan if you're coming from the U.S. The phone allows you to make local and international calls, use Google Maps, research restaurants and posting on social media free of charge. I also recommend upgrading to add excess to the Regent Club. It's an great place to relax in between meetings, sightseeing or shopping. Thank you Regent Hotel Singapore.

The room, an executive suite , was large and well appointed and as we stayed more than four nights, we had access to the Regent Club lounge. That was a delight in itself.

I First stayed in April for a night, and the Hotel Reception and Greeting on arrival was both warm and welcoming....at that point while the Hotel is a classic and mature offering in Singapore I realised then and there that the service would really set the place above the rest. While my original room location was a bit odd, (in my mind) my request for a change of location even quite late at night was met with superb efficiency and care.

Conrad Singapore Orchard,Great high tea - super service,Had high tea one afternoon with the love of my life - the experience was memorable. The high tea comes with a selection of savory and sweets but the creme de la creme was the choice of dessert - I would strongly suggest the Golden Apple which is fashioned from caramelized sugar with delicious iced yuzi apple compote. You can wash this down with a selection of teas and coffee - the pour over coffee is one to try for serious coffee drinkers. Have to mentioned is the Tea Lounge Manager - John - he leads his team to provide great service and engages you in interesting discussions as he patiently prepares your pour over coffee. Storngly recommended if you have a free afternoon to spare and wish to indulge.,5 out of 5,October 2017,5.0 of 5 stars,#12 of 372 hotels in Singapore,0.3553703703703704,0.6599074074074074,67.76851851851852,65.99074074074073,35.53703703703704,Amenities
Conrad Singapore Orchard,Hmmm 5 star??,"Having stayed at other 5 star hotels in Singapore, which were amazing, I thought our room here should have been better than it was. It was a bit dated with dreadful old net curtains. Not being picky, just honest. The staff on reception were very helpful and checking in was excellent, the bathroom was ok with good products. Bed very comfortable, but housekeeping had not bothered to check the tea making facilities and replace them after previous guests. There was no milk, no saucers and a couple of t bags, no coffee. The pool bar was good albeit very slow, and the restaurant Basilico excellent. (Manhattans bar is another matter) which was awful.

Conrad Singapore Orchard,Double standards,"Stayed at Regent for a couple of days in July with club access and it was a pleasant stay --- unfortunately, only on a superficial level. Saw the ugly side of the hospitality industry. Was at club for breakfast one morning, having my coffee and taking a moment to relax and saw that the regular staff were scurrying around, offering personalised service with a genuine smile but the female manager was just idle, in a rather bossy manner, not helping out at all. Not entirely sure of her name but something along the lines of Christy or Christine? Bossy, fake smile...kinda spoiled my morning when I was there to really start my holiday right with a pilates class scheduled for my morning. Strongly suggest avoiding her.

Conrad Singapore Orchard,Great for business trip but just okay for holiday,"I visited this hotel in July 2018 on a business trip. My feedback: Room was small and hotel a little dated. View was not very appealing as my room faced an opposite apartment/condo complex Plugs/outlets were sufficient Internet was fast, plus they provide a mobile 3g/4g device which you can bring around Singapore - however many malls/outlets in the city already provide free WiFi Room service was twice a day, room was very clean. However when I called for housekeeping help service was a little slow, this was probably due to hotel being a little full around my time of visit Toiletries were great- hotel provides loccitane products Water was insufficient. The room only comes with two tiny water bottles unlike my earlier stay in 2016.

Conrad Singapore Orchard,5 star hotel? Maybe 30 years ago.,"First time I've been let down by TA. The regent comes up in a 5 star search of hotels in Singapore. While the restaurants and bars would easily meet that criteria, (having said that, the whole hotel looks mostly original from maybe 20 - 30 years ago) the rooms definitely wouldn't. Old and slightly musty and in desperate need of renovation. When was the last time you stayed at a 5 star hotel that had a step in bath with a plastic shower curtain?

Never did I expect Regent, specifically to Miss Ang Qing Hui, had specially left a card behind and awaiting for my arrival. It definitely made me feel more welcomed and I'm being remembered by Regent. Despite it was a small gesture, it tells a thousand words about their hospitality. I wasn't any VIP who had booked a suite but just a basic room. My day just got a little better even more. Nothing to pick on but would be good if there is discount for room guests patronizing Basilico lunch buffet. It would be perfect if weekend staycation includes a late checkout by 6pm.

Conrad Singapore Orchard,Don't be fooled by the Four Seasons name,"Stayed at the Regent Four Seasons Singapore for a week in October for work. Do not confuse this property with the Four Seasons Singapore a short distance away. Luckily I did not but I was expecting a bit more from a hotel affiliated with the Four Seasons ""brand."" First, the location is great - near Orchard Road with all the shopping and restaurants you can ever need. Also walking distance to the Botanical Gardens (perhaps 10-15 mins).

Conrad Singapore Orchard,Service Extraordinaire,"I spent 4 nights in November at the Regent and found the old adage so true--it's the people which make a hotel experience memorable. My nonstop flight from LA arrived early in Singapore, yet Peter Draminsky, the General Manager, took time out to welcome me to the hotel with a hearty ""we didn't expect you this early."". After our brief chat, I enjoyed breakfast at the club lounge while waiting for my room to be ready. During the next four days, everyone at the club lounge and at Basilico restaurant could not have been more gracious and helpful.

So here's my review. My flight arrived in Singapore at 6am local time, check in wasn't until the afternoon, so in order for me to get a a hotel room that early, I needed to buy the night prior. No problem, the company was paying for it, and I can sort of understand why they had to do that. Check in was a breeze, the front counter staff was incredibly polite and got me settled in. Since I came in early, I was able to get breakfast, which was part of my rate. I was given a room on the fourth floor. It was a big room with a king sized bed.

Conrad Singapore Orchard,Pleasant stay,This hotel is pretty old but it’s the type that has aged gracefully. The building structure style is a bit old - like the atrium style - but they make an effort to make it look nice with flower pots. The room doesn’t feel old. The only thing in the room that makes you realise its age is the shower in bath. But everything else doesn’t feel dated. The bed is particularly very comfortable. The location is also good.

Conrad Singapore Orchard,Coming home to The Regent,"I have just returned from a 4 day business trip to Singapore and felt compelled to write to you to commend you and your team at Regent Singapore. Regent has always been our preferred choice on our visits to Singapore over the last 30 years.Despite it being an older establishment,the personalized service and warmth of the people who have looked after this property over the years have served to keep it on top of its competition. This trip was a little different for me, as there seemed to be an under supply of hotel rooms in downtown Singapore(with almost all hotels being overbooked including Regent)resulting in my having to book an unknown hotel on Rocher for two nights. It was a mistake but I had little choice.After a night I cut my stay short and forfeited one night’s stay.",5 out of 5,January 2020,5.0 of 5 stars,#12 of 372 hotels in Singapore,0.02395833333333333,0.425,51.197916666666664,42.5,2.395833333333333,Services

Brilliant : Service was the best I have seen anywhere and made up for everything else. From reception to bell people they could not be faulted.

When we were about to leave the hotel, we realised that our car was not able to start up and immediately, the three mentioned staffs took the initiative to help us out. They searched for me solutions and search for jumper cable. It was raining so they even offered to push my car to shelter from the VIP lot so repair work can be done when people come.

Normally travelling somewhere in January we had to wait until travel restrictions lifted. Singapore our favourite Asian destination but our first time at the Regent. The hotel was clean and room a good size. Bed a little firm for our liking but room was always serviced well each day. We had a lovely cake and note on our arrival to acknowledge our anniversary. Breakfast daily in Basillico was great. Excellent selection of food on offer and service great. Our time in the club lounge was met with friendly staff, happy to stop and have a chat and offering help in finding things to do in Singapore. A special shout out to Marinah, Figar Yvonne and Jovis.

Conrad Singapore Orchard,Best banquet manager Mano. Will come back again.,Honestly the best banquet manager I have ever worked with. We did an event in regent and he ensures everything is well taken care of. The food flows smoothly and he acceded to my many many requests and make it happen instantly for me. Working with him is such a breeze. One thing that strikes me is his willingness to go the extra mile and he genuinely cares for people. When I had gastric pain/ reflux he recommended mee the drug to take and even took a screenshot for me. Treated me like family. Thank you Mano!

Aside from that, to me - ""new"" Regent was very well decorated/appointed. We used all the facilities from Basilico restaurant and Manhattan Bar, to the gym and pool, all were very good.

Conrad Singapore Orchard,It's the service that lets it down....,"A long wait for check-in (only one employee on duty) after a long flight wasn't a great start. As an IHG Diamond Elite member I asked if an upgrade was available, but was told that there weren't any rooms available at the next level up. I went upstairs and looked on-line - there were rooms available for the duration of my stay at the next level up - I don't appreciate being lied to. The vast open space at the heart of the hotel is a great feature, but there was an amplified event taking place until late on the night of my arrival, meaning I couldn't get to sleep. At breakfast the next morning I was told that I would be charged for breakfast - I advised the employee that I had chosen free breakfast as my Welcome Amenity but, after some tapping, she insisted that I still had",2 out of 5,November 2022,5.0 of 5 stars,#12 of 372 hotels in Singapore,0.22500000000000003,0.5187499999999999,61.25000000000001,51.87499999999999,22.500000000000004,Services

The worst and most disappointing perhaps is the buffet breakfast each day, although most staff were nice.

Conrad Singapore Orchard,Wedding at Regent/Conrad Singapore Orchard (18 Mar 23),"Hosted my wedding here at regent / Conrad Singapore Orchard. Staffs were all super friendly and helpful. Only a bit disappointed that we werent able to stay in the hotel during the wedding due to the renovation. But the hotel does make up with ample other benefits for us. The banquet manager and catering managers were all very helpful and friendly, including the rest of the hotel staffs (Willius , vicky, vanessa , Herman and all other hotel staffs) . Food was fantastic, only one word can summarise it , “perfect”. All my wedding guests all complimented on the quality and taste of the food as well as the portion is huge.

Conrad Singapore Orchard,Dinner wedding banquet,"Chosen Conrad to hold my wedding banquet and I would like to comment that the hotel coordinator Vanessa Goh had been very patient in helping with the planning throughout and ensured that all my requests were met. the Banquet Manager, Anba, was also very proactive and efficient and was very hands-on in assisting his staff for the day.

Conrad Singapore Orchard,Conrad Orchard Singapore: Where Honesty is Not the Best Policy,"Greetings esteemed reviewers, it is with great dismay that I pen this review to share my recent experience at the Conrad Orchard Singapore which was well below expectation. This isn't my first time to stay here. In a previous review, I had bestowed upon the hotel a rating of four stars and had made mention of the General Manager's name, Oscar Postma, as a mild critique of their performance. My stay had been quite wonderful, albeit marred by their proclivity towards complacency in providing minor special requests. However, I found myself the subject of ill-treatment at the hands of the hotel's personnel. Their behavior was nothing short of bullying, as they proceeded to pursue punitive measures against my top-tier membership in their esteemed chain of hotels, ultimately",1 out of 5,April 2023,5.0 of 5 stars,#12 of 372 hotels in Singapore,0.20059523809523813,0.49206349206349204,60.029761904761905,49.2063492063492,20.059523809523814,Services
