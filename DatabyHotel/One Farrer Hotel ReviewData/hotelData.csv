One Farrer Hotel,Wonderful hotel and super staff,"We arrived at a very odd time around 8 AM in the morning at the hotel after flying throughout the night. We were extremely exhausted. When we arrived we were greeted warmly by Naren (reception) who took care of the formalities very quickly. The hotel was fully booked so official checkin time was 3PM. Naren actually recommended to go have breakfast and in the meanwhile he said he would try to manage something. After returning from breakfast, barely unable to function to our delight we saw that he had a room ready for us. We managed to get some rest and now around 3PM we are fresh and about to head out. Without this we would have lost the whole day. Thank you Naren for great customer service ! Other than than the room is great, well located near the MRT and we will surely return.",5 out of 5,September 2023,5.0 of 5 stars,#10 of 372 hotels in Singapore,0.20654761904761906,0.5313492063492065,60.32738095238095,53.13492063492065,20.654761904761905,Services
