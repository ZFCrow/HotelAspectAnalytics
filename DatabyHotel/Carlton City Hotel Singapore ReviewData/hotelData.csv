The front desk officer made a mistake by checking me in a room that is not under my name. Apparently, another guest checking in has the same name as me.

Carlton City Hotel Singapore,Disappointing stay (dirty room),"It was my 2nd time to stay at Carlton City and I returned to this hotel because of the pleasant experience in my 1st stay. It appears that the hotel failed to maintain its high standard after opening slightly more than a year. Check-in: Efficient and the staff was friendly. I booked 2 rooms for the family trip and the rooms were on different floors because one is smoking and another one is non-smoking, which was absolutely reasonable and understandable. One improvement in this area is that we should be given 3 keys so that we could go to two rooms easily. I did ask for this arrangement but was refused. Room: Just opened slightly over a year and I could see moulds on the wall and celling.

Carlton City Hotel Singapore,"decent rates, good sized rooms, great business hotel close to city","I spent a week here in December, I've been to Singapore many times and happened to live pretty much next door to this place when it was being built a couple of years ago. Fast forward, living elsewhere but get back to Singapore every now and then and looking for a decent hotel close to the city I found this one with very good rates. The location is excellent, close to downtown - one mrt stop to raffles place/boat quay and I often walk it when it's not so hot, close to chinatown and club street and with good local facilities in mall next door. Staff were excellent and fixed my local sim card, Pool is fine, as is gym. I didn't have breakfast or any food there as too much other interesting food nearby including the hawker stalls so cannot comment on that.

When I was checking-in at the reception the friendly staff, namely Kristen, told me that breakfast would be offered. I knew my booking did not include breakfast so I got back to her and she reassured me that the breakfast would be free. Sadly, when we arrived the restaurant next day morning, the restaurant staff said we were not entitled for complimentary breakfast. We waited over 10 minutes for them to check with the reservation and they gave us the same answer. It was quite embarrassed but we had no choice but leaving the restaurant.

The bed was also comfortable and the toilet facilities were clean; the hot water was good, with a knob to control the temperature and a separate one to control water (unlike typical hotel settings which require users to tweak and toggle hot and cold water taps simultaneously).

Initial reaction was that it is a sleek and modern hotel. The rooms were reasonably priced but I am sure I can find international hotels chains with similar pricing.

It was just wonderful to arrive at such a high standard hotel, I could not pick any faults with the hotel or staff. I upgraded to a Club room which was well worth the money for all the additional benefits. I will definitely stay there on future trips. Just one suggestion to future guests is to remember to ask for a room away from the elevators if you want quiet...I request this at all hotels I stay at.

The location of the hotel is also perfect so will definitely be staying here again when I visit Singapore in the near future on business.,5 out of 5,April 2016,4.0 of 5 stars,#31 of 373 hotels in Singapore,0.32909090909090905,0.47196969696969693,66.45454545454545,47.196969696969695,32.90909090909091,Services
Carlton City Hotel Singapore,Looking forward to staying for a vacation in the future,About to check out in a few hours. Stayed during the FHA 2016 Expo in a room registered under a colleagues' name. Could've given 5 star but wasn't able to fully enjoyed the Hotel's facilities even with a 4 night stay due to work. But service is world class and everybody are very hospitable. Kudos to Lea at the Front Desk for being patient to our confusing requests and professional in her work. The Handy mobile phone feature in the room as part of the amenities is very useful with its free local Cal's and limited free international calls.

Carlton City Hotel Singapore,"convenient location, close to chinatown",The hotel is located close to Chinatown. There are 2 supermarkets just across the street. Very convenient to shop local food and snacks. I was late check in at almost 1 o'clock and found my TV can't function. The staff helped me to check and replaced a TV box in the middle of the night. A mobile phone is equipped in each room with unlimited 4G and also free local and international call (selected countries). But remember to install your usual apps a night before as the installation takes time.

Carlton City Hotel Singapore,Disappointed,"Stayed two nights on way back from Vietnam. A bit disappointed with this hotel. First up, taxi drivers are confused between Carlton Hotel and Carlton City Hotel. You have to repeatingly tell them that you want Carlton City, even then the driver took us to Carlton hotel from the airport. Why you would have two hotels with similar names in the same city is beyond me. The hotel just lacks soul, no vibe....you book in at the reception and that's it. No staff to open front door, no one with a welcoming smile, no turn down service with nightly chocolates on the pillow. I think we were spoilt with the service in Vietnam. The room was okay, no problems there but the club room is very dead....no atmosphere at all, hardly anybody goes there.

I think for business visits or overnight stays it would be great. I did find the incredible make up mirror in the bathroom to be a huge plus!

I stayed on a B&B basis and had a room on the 6th floor. Room had iron and board, kettle and small supply of instant coffee, t bags etc. I prefer breakfast tea but on some days the standard 2 t bags were jasmine or earl grey.....so instead I collected a couple of breakfast t bags from the breakfast room.

Trying to struggle in and out of lifts with bags and suitcases when you have just flown 14 hours to get to the room and find the key won't work was highly frustrating.

This was my third stay in as many years and overall it was a little disappointing I booked the Club room which is quiet and offers more personal service. Nice to see the introduction of sparkling wine at drinks however food choices for canapés were largely disappointing. Deep fried food when cold is not appealing. The breakfast choices were also cold and I was surprised to see small children in the club room.

An outstanding example of leadership and setting an example. Location wise there is a wide choice of restaurants nearby and bars, supermarkets and vegetable market.

Arriving at the hotel from the UK very early morning (0930) I was expecting to be told that check in would not be available due to rooms not being ready etc, this was not the case. Kesavan on reception greeted me with a warm smile and not only assured me he would allocate me a room immediately but also gave me a choice of floors! All the staff here are professional, polite and happy from the guys on concierge (Raj and Ali to name only two) who made me feel welcome and shared a joke with me to the girls at the patisserie all have excellent customer service levels.

Carlton City Hotel Singapore,Almost perfect.,"From the pictures online, this hotel didn't particularly give me much of an impression but checking in, everything almost exceeded my expectations. The beds in particular were wonderfully comfortable, with some of the softest and most silky smooth sheets I have ever seen in a hotel (even better than many luxury ones). In fact, it was so comfortable i had trouble getting up or even wanting to go out to do anything. Haha. Location was also great, with shops and food all around and an MRT just round the corner :) The toilets were gorgeous as well with really clean clear glass looking into the bedroom, giving it a much larger appearance. However, I wished there was a hand bidet with the toilet as I think its something quite essential in this time and age.

TV channel selections were limited, or standard if you want to be diplomatic. Water pressure was extremely weak, and water temperature fairly unstable. Very slow water flow from the faucet.

Carlton City Hotel Singapore,Perfect location for work!,Back to Singapore for a work trip over the weekend and Carlton City was a perfect location to work from as it was just across the road to where the event was being held. The room had a large view of the city and the bed/pillows were superbly comfortable.

Carlton City Hotel Singapore,Club rooms are a must,"Stayed here for 5 nights in early March, we booked a club room and it was fabulous. Our room was on the 24th floor with views of the harbour. Check in was fast and efficient as was the service of the bell boys. We used the club room lounge for both breakfast and evening drinks and both were excellent for service and friendliness of staff. We used the pool once and that also was clean and well maintained. The use of the handy phone was very useful to us being our 1st time in Singapore and the 2 free laundry items per day was very useful.

Carlton City Hotel Singapore,My favorite Singapore hotel,"Checking in at the Carlton City is like coming home. The first impression is always the large, very clean lobby with that charming subtle ""Asian"" scent and the very friendly staff at the reception desk. Rooms are quite spacious for Singapore and absolutely quiet. You really arrive at that place and relax. They offer a local mobile phone which I never used. Wifi is free and reasonably fast to work from the hotel room. The room service is excellent - try the Hokkien noodles or the Singapore Laksa. I personally don't like the breakfast buffet - just go across the street to buy fresh fruits or pastry from the locals. What I do recommend though is the rooftop bar - not very crowed, pretty casual with good beer and an nice view onto the container harbor.",5 out of 5,March 2017,4.0 of 5 stars,#31 of 373 hotels in Singapore,0.24225595238095238,0.5660952380952381,62.11279761904762,56.60952380952381,24.225595238095238,Value

Carlton City Hotel Singapore,Great hotel & perfect location,"We were staying in Singapore for 4 days pre cruise and after a lot of research decided on the Carlton City as our hotel base. I am pleased to say the choice could not have been better with a supermarket, MRT satiation and restaurants just a stones through from the hotel. Chinatown was a short walk and provided a multitude of cheap dinning options. The MRT system is probably the best in the world so accessing anywhere in Singapore was made very simple. The hotel staff were very pleasent and helpfull with any enquiries and the facilities were excellent. We arrived at 9 am after an overnight flight from the UK and were delighted to be told our room was available allowing us a couple of hours shut eye before embarking on our exploration of Singapore which is a wonderful city.

Carlton City Hotel Singapore,We loved it,"We booked on the hotels web site and got a really excellent rate. We have been to Singapore several times before but have never stayed in this area. We found it ideal and really liked the area which is not touristy at all more for the locals with shopping, hawker centre and small supermarkets close by. A first time visitor to Singapore may prefer to be in the heart of say Orchard Road or the Quays. We arrived at Changi and for $2.50 singapore each we got the metro to Tanjong Pagar with one simple change at Tanah Merah, just walk across the platform. The hotel is a 2 minute walk from the MRT (we timed it). We went in a side door of the hotel which was a bit difficult with our cases but we blundered through!

Carlton City Hotel Singapore,Amazing,This was the first time I went to Singapore and I couldn't have had a better stay. The hotel was perfect and not expensive for a five star hotel. I stayed on the 11th floor and my room had one wall made of windows which gave me a good view on the other tall buildings around and a tiny bit of water I could see through the houses. There are several reasons why I loved this hotel so much: 1. The location - directly next to tanjong pagar station and a lot of stuff in walking distance. 2. The bed - was super comfy. 3. The staff was very friendly and helpful. Especially Kesevan at the concierge. He explained the whole city to me and gave me a lot of tips on what to do in the city. 4. The skybar - had such an amazing view.

My check in after a long flight from the UK was fast and my welcome at the check-in desk was super friendly!

I had great sleeps during my stay. Just make sure you switch on do not disturb on your room - or someone will try to clean your room very early (made this mistake one morning)!

Carlton City Hotel Singapore,"Well-managed hotel, good location, High standard.","Modern and new hotel, managed by responsive and friendly staff, in a good location, 2 minutes walk from the subway, this hotel meets or beats the already high standards one expects from upper-end Singapore hotels. An attractive south-facing lap pool provides a sunny respite. Everything was good. If I must quibble, it would be over trivial issues, such as there not being enough channels on the TV. (Yes, they do have several English language channels but they only show junk such as monsters fighting each other, or biased commentators with a political angle to propagate such as Fox or RT. Except for a few NHK or CNA documentaries there is nothing thoughtful about any of the programming. Conspicuous in its absence is the BBC, one of the world's least biased news organizations).

The hotel is in a convenient location for the metro system as by taxi. The Christmas tree was just beautiful and the staff very friendly. Special mention to Lea from the reception team who gave me a late checkout. The room was perfect and had a great modern bathroom along with a very comfortable bed. The handy phone is a nice touch to help visitors in Singapore. The gym is small but good for a quick cardio type workout.

That said, the bed is very comfortable and buffet breakfast is good. I’d have given a higher rating if I was a business traveller.

The main highlight however (other than the extremely comfy bed) is the 'handy' phone you have in your room.

Carlton City Hotel Singapore,Enjoyable stay,"Have just returned from a short stay in Singapore. I must say I actually booked this Carlton hotel by accident but it turned out in our favour. On arrival we were offered a free upgrade by the hotel in return for a later checkin. On this occasion it really was not a big deal for us to leave our bags and walk around for a while, so that’s what we did. Food on the Club floor although not overly fancy was good with different choices for the evening cocktails.and canapés ( more dinner food). Breakfast was passable and enough to get you through the morning. Location great but in my opinion most hotels are close to something or MRT. Our room was comfortable and very clean, the bed better than most I have encountered in Singapore.

Carlton City Hotel Singapore,Very good hotel in convenient location,"Stayed 3 nights in a deluxe king room. Good-sized room (high ceilings made room feel bigger) with a very comfortable king-sized bed and a nice city view (we were on the 8th floor). Upon first glance the room seemed very clean and luxurious. However the carpet wasn't so clean (as evidenced by the dark soles of our slippers which were worn only inside the room) and the binder containing the hotel info was cracked.

Carlton City Hotel Singapore,A great mistake.,"We really loved our stay in this hotel. I have been to Singapore many times and wanted to stay in The Carlton. However, when booking I chose the wrong Carlton. I arrived at the hotel and was mad with myself for my mistake and asked if there was anyway I could change the booking. The Duty Manager went out of her way to do all she could to rectify my mistake. After calming down. I decided to stay with this hotel. The Hotel staff said, you will love it here and they wasn’t wrong. We had a Club Room and made use of the lounge. This is a great city hotel. Location is great, MRT 50 meters away and China Town a mere 15 min walk. So many places go eat and explore and If you want to go Central it’s only 2 stops on the train. So I highly recommend this hotel.

Carlton City Hotel Singapore,Stay away if you're a nursing mom,"Just checked in here for a business. The hotel is new and well designed. Given the reasonable room rate, it's value for money. However, if you're a breastfeeding mom who needs to pump milk for her baby, do not stay in this hotel. They do not have a freezer for your milk stash or ice packs. The concierge could only shrug that they only have a chiller, not a freezer. It was though it was the first time anyone ever asked for one - well, they're new anyway. If it weren't for the freezer issue (how hard is it to get one?!), I would have probably given this hotel maybe 4 stars.

Carlton City Hotel Singapore,Amazing bellboys,"Firstly, I would like to express our gratitude to Salam and Ravean, who work as bellboys at Carlton City. From the moment we stepped into the hotel, they immediately made us feel extremely welcome and were very hospitable. My partner had heat rash, and Salam came to the rescue by taking us to a polyclinic AFTER his 12 hour shift. Never have I experienced such amazing service, and I want to express my sincere gratitude to him. Additionally, whenever we walked past in the lobby, Salam and Ravean would constantly check in on how my partner was feeling. Please pass on this feedback. Other than that, the hotel room was very clean and spacious. However, a gripe we had was with the quality of housekeeping.

We were taken away with the great reception as soon as we got off the taxi. Bellboy helped unload and took our bags away swiftly. Entered the beautiful lobby and was very impressed with the value we got with what we paid. Rooms were clean and bathrooms were spacious. My five year old enjoyed the huge windows. The complimentary breakfast buffet was absolutely impressive considering what we paid. We were so spoiled at this hotel and thought all Singaporean hotels must be this great.

Carlton City Hotel Singapore,A case of “Just”,"Let’s start with the positives and there are a few. It’s in a good location, not close to shopping but the MRT is only 2 minutes away and so everything is very accessible. The rooms are better than average, not large but have everything you need. The pool whilst not huge is good for a lap swimmer and the surrounds are ok. The club lounge has a nice outside area which is very unusual for club lounges and is a benefit. So why am I saying “just”. Just because of my experience and it is mainly service related. The check in was unwelcoming, unfriendly and I even offered not to check in. I had a confirmed booking and they did not want to honour that. The room card they gave me did not have the right access and the wrong password for the WiFi. Not disastrous but just not good.

Carlton City Hotel Singapore,Flawed,"Stayed in this hotel a few nights with friends and there are many areas it can improve on. The walk in shower doesn’t block water well so often times it gets the floor wet and slippery. The water tap control is too loose so when lifting to get water, the control handle falls down right away. There’s squeaky sound on closet doors so it can be bothersome at night. The blinds not blocking the sunlight 100%. Always long queue for breakfast. They opened another room to accommodate more guests for breakfast, but the coffee machines outside was not turned on. Even in the main area, many time the coffee machines run out of milk. Ketchup is used up without refilling. Bakery food not great. Swimming pool no changing room.

Carlton City Hotel Singapore,Has improved since it opened,"I left a review a year or two back, having stayed shortly after it opened. At the time I didn’t think it rated as well as the Carlton on Bras Basah - but that’s changed. It’s a cosier feel, not as busy, has it’s own roof top bar now which it lacked before. My main criticism would be the premier floor breakfast - it lags behind it’s sister hotel in choice and quality - for example the 3 days i was there, no fresh fruit for breakfast, though the team said they would organise for day 2...sounds picky, but the standards and choice in Singapore and especially around food is so high, it is the norm to expect more!

I've stayed in far flashier / more expensive hotels in Singapore but this is becoming my go to place for short stays in the city. The Tanjong Pajar area has loads of bars / restaurants so no need to take a taxi. The rooms are clean, modern, well thought out and just the right size. The hotel is also quiet - I've never been disturbed by noise and the staff are efficient and helpful. Beds are comfortable and the bathroom great.

Carlton City Hotel Singapore,Very good; not quite 5*,"Stayed over for 4 nights with work; two colleagues also staying hence the choice of hotel. Stayed in a club room; nicely appointed though not up the standards/size of previous club rooms I have stayed in previously in other hotels/locations. Club lounge was ok. Clean, friendly staff and some food. Not very exciting though. Breakfast is steep in price at $35 per day; included in club allowance. Pleased with that as would've been upset to pay that amount for what is a good, though not great, choice. Fresh fruit (tasty, though only 3 choices each day), egg man/lady, lots of warm choices. It was fine. Bar in lobby not big, but again friendly staff, and a good happy hour promotion on a pint of tiger.

Carlton City Hotel Singapore,Jennifer Y. - Duty Manager,"Horrible experience. Condescending and unprofessional manner. Wanted to check out and quickly and made my way to the airport, but encountered subject staff that yelled at us for “not queuing” - we were simply enquiring if there is any express line for check out. So then we queued up, and people behind us from the same queue kept slipping to another one that got serviced first. So much for not having an “express queue”. The gentleman who was in front of me in the same queue had the same frustration as us, seeing people being able to jump queues and we had waited so long on the other hand. It seems that she picks which customers to serve first, not if they get in line first.

Carlton City Hotel Singapore,A lovely stay,"This was a great hotel. While not new, it was in good repair, with pleasant and tasteful public areas as well as guest rooms.

The beds were comfortable, and our bathroom had both bath and shower room, which is very rare these days; high and low lighting options were plentiful. The only thing the room lacked, in my view, were a few more hooks for jackets, robes etc. My first impression was that the room was small, but it felt well arranged, and the rather ingenious touch of having a glass wall between the bed and bathroom (with blind if needed) certainly left an impression of more space.

It is so close the MRT and in being this close allows you access to everything you would want to see & do there. We had such an awesome experience staying at the Carlton City Hotel, the staff were polite, respectful and nothing was too much trouble for them. But the shining jewel in their crown has to Nicholas their manager. Upon arrival when we entered our room there was a fruit basket and a dessert, for our 30th Wedding Anniversary with a hand written note from Nicholas, then another fruit basket was put in our room the day of my Birthday.

Minor cons but no big deal: Pool is not large (hotel caters more for work travellers than family / young kid staycays, so it's perfectly understandable; it's only a con if you book hotel solely for the pool experience).

Carlton City Hotel Singapore,Great Stay,"Great location. There are lots of shops amd eateries around the hotel. Not to mention a street of Japanese and Korean eateries that becomes more alive at night. Hotel was great. The first time a staff acknowledged a guest arrival through a simple gesture while attending to a call. Room was great. Air-con did not really work to temperature setting. I cannot sleep in a cold room so i ended up switching if off. It only goes up to max 25°C even though the setting can go up tp 27°C which was ideal for me. So in a sense, a specific group of guests will not be having a comfortable sleep. Took a while to get hot shower running. Could not figure it out. On the second night, i realised the red hot water indications were peeled off. TV channels ... not impressed. Pretty limited.

Carlton City Hotel Singapore,It’s as perfect as it can get!,"I stayed 3 nights at the final stop of my Asian trip. I chose to stay because of previous good experience. My executive room on the top floors has a panoramic view of the city and it is spectacular. The location is great, only a couple minutes walk from Tanjong Pagar food court/market and MRT station. Along my walk from the hotel to Chinatown is a series of Korean restaurants and other cafes. You’ll never be hungry here. Shopping for snacks and amenities are so convenient since there are FairPrice, Don Don Donki and numerous bakeries in the neighborhood. Pubs and late night clubs are numerous.
