Pan Pacific Singapore,Best Teppanyaki in Singapore.,"We have been to this restaurant many times over the last 30 years and it is by far the best Teppanyaki restaurant in Singapore after all these years. This is largely due to the fact that Eamon Chan is the same chef that has been serving us over the last 30 years. His years of experience shows through in the perfectly cooked beef and seafood. We ordered both the lobster and beef sets and both sets have salmon, scallops & tiger prawns; extremely good value for money.

Pan Pacific Singapore,Four night stay in Singapore,This was a wonderful hotel with a significant wow factor when we stayed here 15 years ago but when we arrived this time we were extremely disappointed to find that the lobby was being refurbished. If we‚Äôd have known before booking then we would have probably stayed elsewhere. We were assigned a refurbished deluxe king room that albeit very nice it lacked clothes storage for a 4 night stay - a few hangars and one or two very small drawers. On complaining to reception we were moved to a panoramic deluxe king room which had the storage we required. The sun beds by the pool are showing their age and splits on the fabric were clearly visible on some beds which is not what I would expect from a 5 star hotel.

As soon as we took a drop at the hotel, we were greeted by a horrible experience as the bellboy (mr. Mutthu) at the gate greeted us by saying, and i quote why have you bought so much luggage ? Me and my wife were totally shocked at such a welcome from the hotel staff. We also brought this matter to the knowledge of the manager, but no action was taken against thesaid staff. Secondly, pan pacific is a big hotel, and they have touch panel intercoms to ask for some basic services.

Pan Pacific Singapore,Great letdown‚Ä¶,"We regretted booking a staycation at the Pan Pacific Singapore to celebrate my birthday. We had booked a skyline suite and hotel was nice enough to grant us a complimentary upgrade, but the room smelled mouldy. Giancarla attended to us and took the effort to find another suitable accommodation for us (the initial alternate room provided to us also had a even stronger mouldy odour). By then, it was already beyond 4 p.m. Meanwhile, she offered a complimentary dinner at the hotel for our family, which I thought was a wonderful gesture given that we had lost almost the whole afternoon to enjoy the room and even missed our lunch time.

The hotel itself is the same and the Club suites are just as they used to be. The staff at the Club lounge (eg Shine, Macluther are still there are doing a wonderful job as they always have. A lovely group of professional and attendtive staff - who have become friends over the years). We stayed for 2 weeks. Lovely suites.

Pan Pacific Singapore,A comfortable stay but a bit tired.,"Stayed in August for 7 nights in what was then known as a Harbour Studio (the hotel seems to be undergoing changes) and is now known as a Pacific Club room. At the time the room did not any lounge access, and apparently now if you choose that room it comes at a premium price and includes access to the Pacific club lounge. The room has great views of Marina Bay although it would be certainly nicer if the windows were floor to ceiling instead of being cut off halfway. The room was nice and comfortable however looking a little tired. The brown features are no longer modern, there were weird lumps in the carpeting, the TV is small and old.

For a flagship Pan-Pacific property, I find this rather disappointing. The room was generally good, measuring about 38 sqm.

Pan Pacific Singapore,Disappointing,Great location for the hotel but massive amount of building work in the lobby so terrible first impressions and very noisy. We had been told minor work in the hotel ballroom. They lied to us and lots of other guests too. Very poor transparency on food allergens in the hotel and led to my daughter who has a nut allergy eating chicken with nuts in after being told by one member of staff it was ok and then the chef saying not.

Pan Pacific Singapore,Experience of a Lifetime,"We arrived late at night were checked in speedily given information about breakfast and went up to our room. We had room 3410 and let me just say if there is a better room on this floor I‚Äôll eat my hats! In the middle of the night we found an oasis of calm with views to absolutely die for.
