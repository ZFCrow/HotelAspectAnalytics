In order to improve the overall sentiment, Cleanliness should be the focus, as it has seen the greatest improvement over time. Other areas to focus on include Amenities, Services, Location, and General, which should all be improved in order to get them to the same level as Cleanliness. Additionally, Value should be focused on, as it has not seen the same growth as the other aspects."
