Park Avenue Changi Hotel,Value is ok.,"Booked this hotel for a 1-night stopover. Location is 5 min drive from airport - although it is so new that taxi's get lost. It is actually right beside Capri hotel. So the hotel is new which is good. It's fairly clean and the rooms are modern. One thing is they seem to have used very cheap beds with no real support. I guess the beds are new but just the quality is poor. It is in a rapidly developing area with numerous shops and cafes and restaurants either just open or opening soon. Price ($180) was ok, but not really worth it. I know SIngapore is expensive. Anyway, I do recommend this hotel for a simple stopover. It does the job - just don't expect to much.",3 out of 5,June 2013,4.0 of 5 stars,#90 of 374 hotels in Singapore,0.11949834479246245,0.48038197097020613,55.974917239623124,48.038197097020614,11.949834479246245,Location

The room was spacious and clean with a safe, iron and tea/coffee making facilities. Beds and pillows were very comfortable. A feature of the hotel is it's proximity to the airport. One stop away on the MRT for which nearly any credit card functions as a ticket. Once at Expo MRT, Park Ave hotel is 100m away. There is a supermarket plus fast food and other restaurants and hotels nearby.

The location is right across the road from the Metro station and adjacent to a new mall with lots of good shops and restaurants. The rooms are set up for an extended stay, with a washing machine and cooking rings, and they are fairly spacious. However a few details left me unhappy. The biggest is that the self-closing door didn’t lock reliably, so I came back from work to find that it had been unlocked all day. There isn’t really a work space in the room, so I set up my computer on the kitchen table, which has rather poor lighting. I asked about detergent for the washing machine and the front desk told me housekeeping would drop some off in my room. They did - but only after the fourth time I asked.

They are very flexible in terms of the length that I am staying in as I do not have a definite check out date (short-term). They have also upgraded my room into a suite which was really spacious. The suite is well equipped with utensils, washing machine (very handy), fridge and stove. It was a shame that on my last day of my stay the government has to activate them as a quarantine hotel. However they were very nice to provide me taxi to their hotel in Rochester and also a cab ride to the airport the next day as Rochester is very far from Changi Airport (which was the reason I chose Park Avenue Changi). I will always go back to them on my stay in Singapore.",5 out of 5,March 2022,4.0 of 5 stars,#90 of 374 hotels in Singapore,0.23222222222222225,0.45185185185185184,61.611111111111114,45.18518518518518,23.222222222222225,Services

We alerted the front desk when we were out for dinner. A couple of hours later, we came back to a clean bathroom and choke was resolved.

Park Avenue Changi Hotel,Nice start to a 2 day business stay,First time I have stayed closer to the airport in Singapore. I have been coming to Singapore for work for the last 20 years but usually end up closer to the city center. For the room price I was expecting less. A colleague of mine from KL suggested we stay here. The rooms are clean and well appointed for working in the room. Check-in with Eleen Tan was flawless and she kindly suggested dinner options and walked me through the first timer at this property basics.

I originally booked the hotel through a third party site (on TripAdvisor) for 188.77 AUD (inclusive of taxes etc.). Sometime after my booking the booking site went into liquidation cancelled all hotel bookings. I was not aware of this until I went to book into the hotel and was told the booking had been cancelled. As I was already at the hotel, I booked in. I misunderstood what rate I was being charged and was absolutely amazed when the charge turned out to be $386 AUD. I emailed the hotel asking for some sympathy for my experience and sought some sort of refund for a reduced rate. No way, they said they were almost full that night and the full rate would remain.

Park Avenue Changi Hotel,I expected a little more...,"We stayed for three nights in September and were left with the impression that it had been a good hotel, but had slipped a bit. The shower in our room had a glass wall with an internal ledge which caught the shower water and caused the water to drain around the rim of the bathtub and then finally to a develop huge puddle on the floor. The fundamental cause was incorrect slope on the bath which forced the water to try to run uphill. The hotel had tried to fix it with silicone sealer, but it needed the bath to be reinstalled at the correct slope. With years of pooled water, the grout had gone mouldy and the leaks had rusted the steel doorframe.. Clearly we were not the first occupants to suffer this problem.

Park Avenue Changi Hotel,"If you have a choice, go somewhere else","Location was OK, next to a mall and a supermarket, which is why it is 2 not 1 star. Charges were 5 star level but service is sub-par. We were traveling with an infant and they patched a call through to our room in the early morning without verifying who the caller was calling (wrong room of course) and woke up our baby. They had a water filter in the room, which would have been good, if it was actually installed correctly. The faucet spun around completely loose. Their ""pool"" was maybe at most 3 feet wide; would be really interesting to see anyone try to swim in it. The lift had a mind of its own, stopping (or not stopping) and random floors, we thought we were going to get trapped in it for a minute. Luckily the doors finally opened without incident.

Obviously, they also leave droppings, mostly on the floor but also on the chairs. A particularly distasteful experience is when they charged for a takeaway coffee from the buffet.

All were understanding and all suppliers made changes/allowed me to cancel fee free - EXCEPT PARK AVENUE CHANGI.

Park Avenue Changi Hotel,Good for business in Changi.,"It is close to the airport and the major business center of Changi. There is an MRT station (Expo) across the street and the Changi City Point Mall with a staggering # of food options is a hundred meters or so away. The rooms are typically small, as I find is true in most Asian hotels. The rooms are clean and the wifi service is very reliable and high speed. I was on the 7th floor and well away from the elevator so it was quiet. The hotel restaurant, Cali, has a breakfast buffet and is open 24 hours. Get to breakfast by 7:30 because a lot of tour operators stay here and by 0800 the staff cannot keep up with the folks emptying the chaffers. Get your drink first, then your food.

Park Avenue Changi Hotel,Disappointed with customer service,"After a long travel day I arrived at Changi Airport and found a hotel near by, I accidentally selected the option of twin beds instead of a king, the price difference between the two options was a few dollars and I figured I could pay the difference upon check in. When I arrived, I was told the upgrade would cost an extra $20 + + (I have no idea what plus plus means nor did I want to find out) I was better off cancelling my reservation and doing it all over again online, instead I was given the option to push my two twin beds together. Really? For a “world-class” business hotel you would think you would just change my room type considering it was obviously a mistake. Why would a solo traveller request two twin beds?

Park Avenue Changi Hotel,Overnight for airport,We stayed here for a short time as an alternative to the airport hotels. It’s conveniently next to a large mall for food and last minute shopping before heading home. We’d stayed 2 weeks before in a city hotel as we were using Singapore as a hub for a big family trip. PA Changi were nice enough to store a whole bag of winter stuff before our stay which made our travelling much easier. Unfortunately their pool was under maintenance and there were no alternatives for adults (and none for kids as the outdoor water playground at the mall was shut too) but we weren’t at the hotel long enough for this to matter,4 out of 5,August 2018,4.0 of 5 stars,#90 of 374 hotels in Singapore,0.05535714285714285,0.407936507936508,52.767857142857146,40.7936507936508,5.535714285714285,Value

Park Avenue Changi Hotel,Good business park hotel,"If you are here on business in this part of Singapore, great hotel. Staff are excellent, from the concierge, to reception staff, to room service. The rooms are clean. Close to the airport. There is a train station nearby, underground so silent. There is a huge shopping complex with many many oodles of eateries and factory outlets and a supermarket. Large Lap pool and gym on the roof. Location is clean, tidy, busy outside when staff go to and from the station. But not crowded. Made me think of every business park I had been in in NW Sydney, Gold Coast, Macquarie Park.

Park Avenue Changi Hotel,Nice hotel right next to EXPO,"I had a conference at Expo and so stayed here for a few nights. This hotel is not too large in itself, but the room was not small from Singapore standards and was clean. It was nice to have a glass window between the bathroom and the room. The hotel provided a free cell phone but it was extremely slow, so I did not use it. Just one stop from Changi airport and took me a few minutes to walk to Expo, so it was very convenient in terms of location for my needs. However, it is far from the downtown, so I wouldn't have stayed here for tours or for family.

Park Avenue Changi Hotel,The worst hotel I have stayed ever,Let me start with the good thing about the hotel which is the location. That’s it. There is nothing beyond. I would say they are surviving because travellers don’t have a choice other than two hotels in Changi biz park. First of all the hotel lacks space. There is practically no lobby area. People are asked to wait outside. One can imagine waiting outside for your room in a humid place like Singapore Can you imagine a hotel without a rest room at the lobby/reception area ? That’s park avenue for you. You have to use the public rest room at the mall. The beds are bad. Atleast the one in twin bed rooms. They aren’t stable. When I complained I was asked to upgrade at a charge ! I was not looking for luxury but I was looking for a bed that doesn’t give me a back ache.,1 out of 5,April 2018,4.0 of 5 stars,#90 of 374 hotels in Singapore,-0.027777777777777766,0.2601851851851852,48.61111111111111,26.01851851851852,2.777777777777777,Location

For an airport hotel, we were not expecting a huge amount, but we were surprised at how large and comfortable the room was.

Around the hotel there is various shopping outlets, and a McDonald's and Burger King.

Park Avenue Changi Hotel,"Convenience, right near Changi airport.",We had an overnight layover in Singapore and wanted a hotel close to the airport. On arrival to Singapore it was a 5 minute taxi trip to the hotel ($27SGD). The hotel is in the business district and was very quiet. There is a shopping mall right next to the hotel as well as great big supermarket which is awesome for a short stay. We discovered that the Expo MRT station was a 2 minute walk from the hotel and only one stop to Changi airport ($1.70SGD for one adult) so used this to get back to the airport. This hotel was also extremely accommodating and allowed us to change our booking even though we had booked a non-refundable booking on booking.com due to the airline changing the date of our flight.

There are no fanciful facilities nor amenities that are worth a mention. Service at reception was also boring with staff seemingly rather disinterested in their surroundings.

For my previous two trips, I stayed in Marina Bay and was spoiled by the luxury of the upscale hotels in that area.

Park Avenue Changi Hotel,Family Staycation,I organised a family staycation last weekend. I was greeted warmly by Choon Yen. He was professional and check in was quick. I was escorted to the elevator by his manager Nafisah. She informed me the way how to scan the room keys at the sensor. Quite tricky at first. Glad she show us! The room was a good size for a family of four and the bed was comfortable. There was no restaurant for room service but there is a mall nearby with plenty of local food and restaurants. NTUC supermarket close by is a plus too. Night time was very quiet as the hotel is right smacked in the Business Park area. Very pleasant staycation!

This is ridiculous because I had booked the room online about two months ago. You have ample of time to inform me if that was the case. But you didn't. In fact, you chose to send me to another hotel branch at Rochester as I was told that there were no rooms available at the nearby hotel at Changi. I was promised to be given a room on the next day but there is no proper following up by Changi branch.

Park Avenue Changi Hotel,Perfect Value-for-Money Stopover,"Very good, clean, modern, quiet hotel relatively close to Changi Airport. Based on our very pleasant stay, I'd say it's been somewhat Under-rated by some reviewers both here and on booking.com. Yep, no restaurant, breakfast room or bar ... and yes that is a negative. But still one of the best value-for-money hotels near the Airport - especially if, like us, you're on a one night stopover with long haul flights both the day before and day after. Rooms were Comfortable, spacious and, pleasingly, rather more 'upmarket' than the hotel's on-line shots suggest - including a bath which was great after a long flight.

There were 2 staff only on duty and the other staff was attending to another guests. As my family and I walked in, I expected her to attend to me immediately upon noticing our entry but I waited for a good 1 minute before the security had to tell her that I am there and to attend to me.

Park Avenue Changi Hotel,Good hotel for quick stopover near Changi Airport,"This is a good hotel for a business stay, particularly if you are going to be at the Changi Business Park and looking for a place to stay near the airport.

The hotel is in a quiet area and there are various restaurants dotted around, a supermarket opposite the main entrance as well as a reasonably sized shopping centre very nearby. The room was clean and spacious with the various amenities one would expect. The bed was comfortable, the WIFI had decent bandwidth and the air conditioning not too loud to disrupt sleep.

Negatives were- took the taxi driver ages to find because of the construction. The bathroom wasn't that great. You could literally hear the water draining and it felt ""old"".

The room was nicely designed and finished with a huge bed and good shower.

Park Avenue Changi Hotel,"Perfect near-airport stayover with restaurants, groceries, shopping, transit","The Park Avenue Changi Hotel is one stop on the MRT (metro train) from Singapore Changi airport. Unlike in many cities, the one stop to the airport is priced as just a regular stop, so for me in January 2015 it was S$ 1.50 (plus 10 cents for the reusable ticket). Since the airport MRT station is right in the center of the airport the Park Avenue Changi Hotel is in effect an airport hotel that you can reach on an airport shuttle for a nominal fare. Just take the MRT to Expo station; from the standpoint of a person arriving at Expo station from Changi, the hotel will be behind you on the left.

Park Avenue Changi Hotel,Very disappointed,Arrived Singapore late and had a layover for one night. Stayed at Park Avenue and all I can say is what a disaster. Taxi couldn't find the place ... finally arrived at approx. 11pm and just wanted to relax in a room. Took what seemed forever to finally check in after so much mucking around with paper work at the front desk. Went upstairs to my room to find the bedding wasn't what I had booked. Had to wait again for somebody to finally come up to assign a new room. Went to make a cup of tea - no sugar no tea bags - had to call reception and wait again. Nothing around this area at all if your looking to eat and hotel doesn't have a restaurant. Reception apologised and gave me a cup of noodles. The room was comfortable but I felt like I was in a box.

Park Avenue Changi Hotel,Great Short Stay Hotel,"Very nice hotel in business centre about 10 minute drive from airport. Great to have all the amenities, including a washer/ dryer which was fantastic!! Area is business focused and has restaurants and shops (as well as a large supermarket/ food court) around. Staff were helpful and professional. Rooms were immaculate - as was the pool on the roof, although very small. The room had a separate bedroom and lounge area which is also great as one of us slept and the other watched TV. Room also had microwave and fridge -- also great!!

We especially loved the washer+dryer that was in our room as opposed to a shared laundry area, so thumbs-up for this! There is also a large NTUC supermarket right next to the hotel (closes at 10.30pm) should you need to buy necessities. I would not recommend taking the breakfast as there are loads more choices available right outside the hotel or even just a 10-min walk away at Changi City Point mall. It's a bit unfortunate that the construction was going on around the hotel so you would have to walk round them to reach the mall and Expo MRT station.

Park Avenue Changi Hotel,"A good business hotel in the Changi district, but as an airport hotel, it needs improvement","Park Avenue Changi Hotel is a good business hotel located five minutes away from the MRT EXPO station. This hotel does not have any shuttle service to and from the airport, which is quite disappointing. Yes it is one MRT station away from the airport, but if you have many bags, I will recommend you taking a cab to the hotel, or if you are transiting, you should store the heavy bags at the airport ""left luggage"" facility, which are available throughout the airport. The MRT system in Singapore is very efficient and clean, and the ride to the EXPO station from Changi Airport is short. Due to the all the construction in the Changi Business District, there is no covered walkway to the hotel and you need to walk through all the temporary walkways.

Park Avenue Changi Hotel,Quiet area (during the night),"If you're a night owl and looking for place to hang out till the wee hours of the morning, then this is not for you. I like this place due to the close proximity to the airport (2 mrt stops away) and also it's located in a very quiet area during the night. This area is actually a business park, so I guess it's good for business travelers. I actually booked the standard room, but was upgraded to the one bedroom suite for the 2 times I stayed there. I was even allowed to check in early (1st time around 11 am plus and the 2nd time around 10am). But of course these are subject to their availability.

Park Avenue Changi Hotel,Excellent business hotel close to Changi Airport,"Park Avenue is a new hotel located in the Changi Business park which houses number of businesses. It is bang opposite to the Expo MRT, which is one stop from Changi Airport station. So if if you are transiting, it is a much cheaper option than Crowne Plaza at the airport. Rooms are small but have wall to wall, ceiling to ceiling windows which makes it feel roomy. Beds are very comfortable, and toilets are modern. One small issue is that there is no restaurant at the hotel, but plenty restaurants around it. There is also a grocery store in the same plaza as the hotel.

I am not quite sure if this hotel has a restaurant of its own but having Changi City Point and Expo (LRT station) at its doorstep makes up for it. The rooms are clean and cozy too.

The existence of a large retail mall right next door takes care of the snack needs if you have one.

The fact that it was just 10 mins away from the airport and it only cost us $150 to stay until noon was the selling point.
