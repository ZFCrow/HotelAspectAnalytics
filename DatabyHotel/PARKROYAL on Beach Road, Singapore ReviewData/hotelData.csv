A pleasant enough room, if a little uninspiring. There was, however, a significant issue with the room which necessitated a return trip to reception - but Darryl put it right quickly with an upgrade to the Club Premier room (without Club Benefits, of course).

"PARKROYAL on Beach Road, Singapore",Decent hotel but bad service,"Personally, my experience was quite unpleasant. The hotel itself is really nice and is good enough for a 4-star. However, the receptionist has not been the most helpful. I went for a company-sponsored trip which is why the company made the reservation through the company corporate card in the first place. However, when I was checking in, I was told that I needed to provide a one thousand dollar deposit. I find this quite unusual as the amount of the entire stay is only about 809 SGD. Where I come from, the cash deposit is usually less than 20% of the amount of the entire stay. I did not have this cash with me as I only have enough cash for transportation since my meals are also covered in the conference I'm attending at.

"PARKROYAL on Beach Road, Singapore",Very poor standard of service.,Very poor standard of service. I have never been told “no” so often by hotel staff at a 5 star hotel. We asked for assistance from reception and the hotel concierge to arrange a doctors appointment or to have one come to the hotel. Absolutely no effort was made to help. We were directed to the local hospital to sit and wait. Even when I asked again for assistance to book an appointment at a clinic ( I found a few clinics open on Sundays) I was told it wasn’t possible. I also asked again to have a doctor come to the hotel and again my request was dismissed. In reality the hotel staff had no interest in helping. This is the standard I would expect at a backpacker hostel. There’s a big issue with consistency at this hotel. We stayed for 9 nights in a Club Level room.

"PARKROYAL on Beach Road, Singapore",Disappointing,"This hotel was the very first stop on our honeymoon, the staff were friendly and at first glance it looked clean and modern. Then we got to our room… it was so dirty! Smears all over the mirrors, hairs everywhere in the bathroom and stains on the bed. Our first night was LOUD, chairs bring moved around at 2am and loud music. Night 2, NYE, this is when we discovered we were above the hotel “club”. On arriving back to our hotel after watching the fireworks, our whole room was shaking from the music. It was unbearable!!! My husband asked reception to turn it down, it did get quieter by 3am.

"PARKROYAL on Beach Road, Singapore",Fantastic in every way!:),"I had the most fantastic experience at the Parkroyal Hotel Beach Road during my recent stay in Singapore. The hotel is magnificent, especially the twinkling lights on the forecourt as you enter at night. Dillah and her team are the most efficient, warmest and kindest I have ever met. They bent over backwards to ensure that I had the most amazing experience imaginable. Very late one night, while burning the midnight oil in their beautiful lounge, they even suprised me with a heavenly smoked whisky cocktail - the best I have ever had in my life!

No other public seating areas where you could relax with an alcoholic drink. Single glassed window in bedroom resulting in road traffic noise and early wake up call at 0600hrs to call to prayer.

Check out the previous review from June 2017 - good things were much the same this time round too. Negatives? This time they were hardly worth mentioning. The Park Royal delivers. As you’d expect the place was much the same – crescent shaped structure rising to seven stories on Beach Road opposite the ‘Arab Quarter’. For those of you who like the cuisine of North Africa/Middle East, this is where you explore the different tables of an evening.

"PARKROYAL on Beach Road, Singapore",Value for money staycation,Booked for the stay just an hour prior to check in. I booked a Deluxe Room and received a complimentary upgrade to Orchid Club Deluxe Room (without the Club Privilege though). I feel it will be a more pleasant experience if they also extend the club privilege to those who received complimentary upgrade. Requested for late check-out and was told that I can check out at 4pm on the following day. The room is clean and spacious. There is some visible aging after all it has been there for years. Bathroom didn't come with bathtub and it is relatively small. Pool is not big but sufficient for a dip. Seem like there is some miscommunication on whether prior reservation is required. Was told that no reservation is required but the person mending the pool told us otherwise.
