Hard Rock Hotel Singapore,5 star?,I stayed at the hotel for a retreat on a weekend. I read that it’s a 5 star hotel and honestly it didn’t quite feel so. The rooms are nice but basic. To me it just didn’t feel luxurious enough.

Hard Rock Hotel Singapore,Disappointing,"We stayed at the Hard Rock Hotel in October for six days after our trip to Cambodia . I would have to say I was very disappointed in this place. The grounds are very beautiful and the pool area is nice and close to the forem to go have meals but that’s where it ends. There is no service there, no happy smiling people. Everyday I had to keep going and asking for coffee and creamer as they never left them. The bathroom mirror was never cleaned in the six days we were there. We couldn’t change the air conditioner so it was either too cold or if we turned it off it was too hot. Prices are ridiculously high if you buy food or drinks. Hod one cocktail at the pool bar and my husband a beer and it cost us $38. So of course never had another.

Hard Rock Hotel Singapore,Not worth the money,"I generally don't like to leave negative reviews, and i'm especially cynical when someone has unrealistic expectations but Hard Rock Hotel on Sentosa is supposed to be a luxury hotel and at >$300/night for a standard room I had much higher expectations. We were informed that because we wanted 1 bed (king instead of 2 doubles) that the room would not have a balcony. The second disappointment was that the rooms are in terrible need of an update, there are chips in the paint, the bathroom is more what you'd expect of a budget motel, shower stained (even though it was technically clean) no bathtub, no toiletries (I had to call up to request them). In the form of seating there was a single chair and a bench seat.

Hard Rock Hotel Singapore,Overall a hit (with a few misses),"Check in was friendly and easy and we were able to check in early. We were on the 6th floor overlooking the carpark. There are only one set of lifts and it was a long walk to the room from the lift but not a big deal. The rooms are a great size and being on the top floor the room had huge ceilings. The bathroom is a great layout with a separate toilet and a huge shower head. The pool is fun and our 5 year old loved the water slide. The breakfast buffet offers variety but is expensive, coming in at over $100AUD for 2 adults and 1 child. The misses are cleanliness, there was the same bit of rubbish that was there when we checked in still there when we checked out under the bed side table as well as sand on the floor that was not vacuumed up.

Thus I had to keep bringing her to the shower area to wash her. Next the tv cannot be pulled out to plug in your ipad or laptop hdmi to watch movies. And so we were stuck with three movie channels only out of which two was Chinese? Seriously? This Hotel is good for people who wanna use the pool and just sleep.

Other then some rock and roll mementos on the walls, some graphics and music in the background, it could have been another 4-star hotel.

While this is a great initiative, I would’ve preferred to have at least 1 bottle provided to take with me while we are out.

Hard Rock Hotel Singapore,Decidedly average,"Stayed here while attending a conference on site. Having stayed at both Marina Bay Sands and now Resorts World Sentosa it is clear why MBS is the runaway success it is. The only reason to stay at RWS is if you really must be located on Sentosa Island. My room in the Hard Rock hotel was on the small side and the decor felt in need of maintenance, specifically the closet doors wood was splintering and the main door to the room had seen better days (and did not latch closed by itself... needed a push/pull). I moved out into a main Singapore the minute I did not need to be on Sentosa.

Hard Rock Hotel Singapore,"Great location, but terrible service","Definitely one of the worst hotel experience ever. When I was checking in not only did it take a very long time, they gave us the wrong room. So, we had to change the room, which took up a lot of our time. We had plans that afternoon, but that plan went out the window b/c of not being able to check in at the hotel properly!! What is more, they try to charge us again even though we’ve paid for the hotel already. The staff who I won’t mention his name was adamant we had to pay on top of the deposit. We gave the staff document that stated PRE-PAID with a bold letter on the top right-hand corner so he couldn’t possibly have missed it. That definitely left a sour taste in our mouth.

Check in took a while, was told room will be ready at 3pm. Staff did not look at you when telling you something, instead mumbling at the monitor.

It was quickly dismissed and excused by the front desk staff that it had been indeed returned to us. We checked our belongings again and again, and explained that we indeed don't recall the ID being returned to us and the front desk staff insisted at least twice that it had been returned to us.

Hard Rock Hotel Singapore,"Great location for family holiday, skipping small points","Resorts world at Sentosa is a fantastic experience for kids, you could spend a week easily and still be enjoying it. Hard rock does its job as part of the group with a great pool for the kids and the gimmick factor. To be considered a top notch resort it needs to lift its game in customer service. Check in/ out experience is not efficient but more of an issue is the house cleaning! Over our three night stay they never properly cleaned the room once, always cutting corners - 1st day moving dirty cups to sink of bathroom and leaving them, 2nd day taking towels and not replacing and failing to remove rubbish from room, third day leaving used plates and again not removing rubbish.

Hard Rock Hotel Singapore,Surprisingly good!,"We had stayed in other establishments in Sentosa during previous visits but thought we’d give Hard Rock hotel ‘a go’ this time round as we had wanted to experience staying and spending some time at Resorts World where the hotel is located. Our room and amenities were good - clean and comfortable. The fact that the hotel is in such close proximity to restaurants, shops and the theme parks is a huge advantage compared to the other hotels in the Sentosa vicinity which are quite secluded. The hotel is family friendly, so you can expect kids running around with mums and dads in tow. The pools - there are a number of them which suits all ages including a pool bar tucked in the corner. My only beef with the hotel is the access to the pools.

Hard Rock Hotel Singapore,Definitely a NO,"First, I booked this hotel because of their water slide, but this slide is just a slide without water (see picture), even my 4 yrs old cannot slide down no mention other kids, the only kids can play that was the brave boys who ran and jumped down the slide. Asked staffs and they claimed the slide work fine. I girl was so disappointed and I was so regret why I did not book shangri-la. Second, the room is sucks. There are flies in shower room. Washroon is doorless, there is only partial door for shower and tiolet, so you can imagine all stream and smell spread all over the room. Room interior was wearing and old.

Hard Rock Hotel Singapore,Great Staff & Service,Well... my family did not stay in this hotel. But we happened to have our breakfast at the hotel. We were served by a friendly female Singaporean staff (Think her name is either Aileen or Irene. She was wearing the blue collared shirt & jeans) at the restaurant. She was attentive & friendly. She provided great customer service. Another great staff was at the hotel reception. His name is Kenneth. I was enquiring about the hotel rates & availability. He was patiently checking for us & explained to us the rates & type of rooms that Hard Rock Singapore has. The last staff that we want to praise was the Malay staff at Hard Rock Shop. She was knowledgeable about the shop’s merchandise. Kudos to all the staffs.

Hard Rock Hotel Singapore,Great place to stay,Stayed 1 night just for relaxation. Offered a corner room which is far away from the lift lobby. So had to walk a bit to reach the room. Initially regretted taking up the corner room due to the walking distance to the lift lobby. However upon getting into the room realised that its bigger than the normal room which i stayed previously at the same hotel. The bathroom is also separated behind a wall. Other room i recall its separated via a glass panel only. So its a good deal. More space for my kids to run around the room. Maybe next time i will request for corner room if such room is available. As usual the pool area is the best.

Hard Rock Hotel Singapore,Not as expected,"It is true that hotels in Singapore are expensive compared to other countries which by default creates some expectations. Unfortunately my first experience staying at a Hard Rock was not as expected. The room was big and very nicely organized. Amenities are good as well but nothing more. Actually I was disappointed by 3 things: the light at the bathroom was not strong enough giving me a hard time to save. I have to admit this is something I noticed at few other hotels as well. The second point was a strange smell at the bed. I tend to believe it is on purpose as it was closer to a perfume (definitely not implying that it was dirt - sheets were very clean) but it was annoying for my taste. The last comment is on AC.

Dinner in the main restaurant end at 9.30 pm and after that you dont have where to eat.

Hard Rock Hotel Singapore,Sentosa,"Swimming pool The hotel is located in Sentosa, you have to take the sentosa express or RWS bus. Good :The pool area can be divided into lap pool, a sand beach pool, pool bar and a kid’s area with water slide. The bed was comfortable, the room has an LCD TV with a few English channels, mini fridge, iron and kettle. The bathroom is separate from the toilet but there's no tub.You can access the closet from the bathroom. Not so good: The room can use a bit of brighter lights as it is dim. Perhaps the Rock N Roll element but when you’re travelling with children it is a bit of a challenge.

The Hard Rock room was uninspiring, not very spacious whilst the decor was bland and tired. The hotel lacked any real relevance to the music scene which one would expect in Hard Rock properties. The biggest disappointment was the buffet breakfast which seemed to be geared to a 3 star hotel.

Hard Rock Hotel Singapore,No separation between toilet/shower area and bedroom,"The location of the hotel is quite great, walking distance from Universal Studios, many high quality restaurants nearby, and easy access for car or via monorail. The pool is also excellent, large enough with sand area, lap area and pool bar (although that one is not always open). Perhaps there could be a few more play items for younger kids. What is less impressive is the room.

Hard Rock Hotel Singapore,Perfect Place for a family vacation,"We came to the hotel for 4 night with the family package that included tickets to the attractions. Our vacation started badly with a problem in our room, but the minute the duty manager - Jason, heard about it he did everything he could to fix our problem and make our stay pleasent. The hotel itself is nice but what made the vacation was the amazing service (from the manager to the Reception, Bell boys, Pool bar service...) That do more then beyond so you will enjoy your stay. The Pool has real sand ! Very kids friendly. Although the hotel was full , the pool is so big you dont feel crowded. Perfect place to take toddlers since most of the pool area is shallow.

Bryan, the barman, was so friendly. Food at the poolside is reasonable. Drinks (both alcoholic and non-alcoholic) are expensive but I found this to be the case all over Singapore.

Hard Rock Hotel Singapore,Hard Rock Hotel Shop,We went here to go to the Hard Rock Shop within the Hard Rock Hotel and were expecting to have the ‘Hard Rock Staff Experience’ that one comes to expect of hard rocks - we have been to around 110 unique hard rock locations around the world so do know what to expect. The staff here in the shop were fairly lacklustre and did not have that hard rock feeling at all and we were quite disappointed to say the least. They were more interested in speaking in their own language than interacting with the customers and never moved from behind the counter - not what Hard Rock is about - should be much more enthusiastic to call itself a Hard Rock Shop. The shop has a fair stock but the service does let it down unfortunately.

Long queues to get the key, over crowded pool, long waiting time (see point 2). 2. I checked in at 11+am.

Hard Rock Hotel Singapore,HORRIBLE - Stay Elsewhere.,"It has been year's for me writing reviews but Hard Rock Hotel Sentosa has brought me back as it was bad enough for me to do so. This is a very poorly managed and maintained resort. The staff just don't want to engage with the guests at all. When you do speak with them, clearly they don't care. I am a resort owner and operator in Thailand and if we ran our facilities like this we would get zero business. This is a 2.5 star at best. Horrible check in experience. One staff working ( we were told someone was off sick) hahaga incredible. There is NO RESON to stay with this overpriced, under serviced brand.

To be honest, this review doesn’t do justice to most of the staff at housekeeping, valet and reception. Mr Hidayat is 1 gentleman I believe from the valet team as well as Mr Rajendran from housekeeping who did a really good job in providing excellent hospitality services. Unfortunately can’t say the same for staff at the Rock Bar. Only 1 Indian girl had a nice and smiley face. The rest behaved in a way as if we had stolen their inheritance. I don’t get why.

Hard Rock Hotel Singapore,A lot wrong! 4/10 for the price,"A lot to like and a lot to dislike. (coming from an airline crew) Since sentosa is under going a lot of redevelopment, make of the entrances are closed. This led to us having to walk unknown paths and find out own way. this is with family of age 65 and upwards. The rooms are old and it shows. the doors feel weak the plugs dont work. the bathroom dosent have a door so this gets awkward for family to change. There is a drying rack in the balcony that is just pathetic.

Hard Rock Hotel Singapore,I won’t be back there,"Firstly, on arrival we were advised there were no more king beds available, as they ran out. This was an inconvenience as I was staying with my partner and we now had to sleep in single beds. The lady behind the counters didn’t seem to empathise and when I asked if we could have breakfast included for the inconvenience she rejected it and said we would have to pay. Many stains in the carpet in the hall way. The luggage worker didn’t listen to our request and delivered our luggage to the wrong room. Everything was super overpriced.

Couldn’t put your make up on in the bathroom as too dark and no PowerPoint in bathroom either.

Only 1 restaurant that doesn’t cater for vegan and very little vegetarian options. Repair works were being carried out in the hotel for which no advance notice had been given.

It was only when I continued being firm that they got me a change of room.

Hard Rock Hotel Singapore,Great Location,We stayed at the Hard Rock Sentosa Island last week for 3 nights as a famly of 4. The hotel itself as previously mentioned has a very dark lobby / foyer area. Yes that maybe Hard Rocks style but it needs brightening up. We did arrive early and managed to get an early checkin at 10.30am and after a long flight from London it was very much appreciated! The pool area is quite nice but only one entrance point which I can understand as they may get unwanted visitors otherwise. The hotel itself needs a few tweaks from Wifi to lighting.

Hard Rock Hotel Singapore,Average rooms with above average prices,"Compared to the other hotel properties on Sentosa Island, I'd have to say this Hardrock's service was mediocre. Upon booking of the hotel room, I requested for a king bed instead of Twin beds, and requested for a higher level. Upon checking in, I was granted none. I was given a room on the 3rd level, the lowest level with rooms in the building with twin beds. Well I understand that requests are subjected to availability but the least the counter staff could have done was to offer an alternative of waiting till the room was available?

However, the staff are fantastic, the room service is great, the rooms where big, with a pull out bed (under the double bed) if you have a family or three. I would stay there again, if I had my kids with me, as it is so convenient for easy and fast access to the kids entertainment on Sentosa. Very efficent life guards around the pool, which is great with so many kids swimming at anyone time.",3 out of 5,September 2016,5.0 of 5 stars,#14 of 16 hotels in Sentosa Island,0.21149749373433588,0.47650375939849615,60.5748746867168,47.65037593984962,21.149749373433586,Amenities
Hard Rock Hotel Singapore,Average hotel lacking Wi-Fi and Expensive,We spent 2 nights in Singapore and was very disappointed. The room was plush but that was about all it has going for it. Charging for WiFi in 2016 is just not acceptable. Also it was undergoing refurbishment and although we knew this the noise was unbearable. There were apparently no other rooms available (it was out of seasons and it has hundreds of rooms and it was empty). We complained to staff and found them to be unfriendly and unhelpful. The restaurant is very expensive (okay Singapore is expensive but this room it to the next level). Quite disappointed having stayed at resorts world before in different countries I expected more. That said we enjoyed our time in Singapore and Universal. A few simple changes can improve the hotel.,2 out of 5,September 2016,5.0 of 5 stars,#14 of 16 hotels in Sentosa Island,-0.0951388888888889,0.44817460317460317,45.24305555555556,44.817460317460316,9.51388888888889,Value
Hard Rock Hotel Singapore,"Big Name, Moderate Service","I booked a staycation on 26th October 2016 for my wife's birthday celebration. We went there with quite a high expectation but end day, the service was very moderate. Definitely not worth the money spent. Hotel staffs were just fulfilling their own job scope, forgetting that it will be good to go extra mile for their guests. It was quite disappointing to hear just a very nonchalant and cold ""no"" as an answer, when I asked if there is an promotions available so that I can surprise my wife for her birthday.

Hard Rock Hotel Singapore,Horrible. More like a 3 star hotel.,"I booked this hotel for a weekend getaway , expecting some sort of 4 star service. Don't get me wrong , I'm not some pampered guest expecting exceptionally good service when I did not pay for that. Hope this help other travelers when considering to book this hotel. Check in : We reach around 4pm on a Saturday, well the check in queue took quite awhile 15-20mins . However this did not bother us much as we thought ""oh it's just the weekends"" . The lobby was really lackluster. It was a hard rock hotel but it doesn't seem to exude the ""hard rock"" feel - 1 rock shop , 1 bar , a few displays. Rooms: Was really a disappointment -rooms was small with a double bed and dull brown sofa -Almost no hard rock elements. -no complimentary wi-fi (found this really hard to accept) -the floor",1 out of 5,November 2016,5.0 of 5 stars,#14 of 16 hotels in Sentosa Island,-0.1163888888888889,0.42277777777777786,44.18055555555556,42.277777777777786,11.638888888888891,Services

There is a 7-Eleven in the car park of the convention centre attached to the building, to get a cold beer or bottle of wine to put in your room fridge to safe some dollars.

Hard Rock Hotel Singapore,Not totally as expected,When one hears World Resort and sees the amazing facilities that Sentosa Island has then one would expect more from this hotel. The reception staff were friendly and on the whole the general areas all looked well maintained. The dated parts were in the rooms themselves. I expect that something like the Hard Rock would have state of the art entertainment in the rooms but the TV and video system was very dated. The signal drops at times and the on demand movies are both expensive ($19+) as well as limited (about 20 titles and nothing too modern). The Bed was weirdly positioned to the tv and the table had one seat only.

Hard Rock Hotel Singapore,Excellent customer service!,Have to say I was a little worried about this booking before I went - not only from reading the reviews on here but also because I'd booked it through getaroom without (stupidly) reading all the bad stuff about that site. Anyway we got an amazing price and the pools were the big selling point with the kids so I double checked the booking was there and paid for before we got there and hoped for the best. So we got there and were pleasantly surprised. We came in on an early morning flight and were able to complete check in when we got to the hotel at 8am - of course room wasn't ready but no surprises with that. Check in was fast and easy and staff were pleasant. When we came back in the afternoon about 3 we were able to skip the queue and just pick up our room key and go.

Hard Rock Hotel Singapore,Wonderful hotel with great location,"Recommend this hotel for family with young kids just like me. We went as a family of 2 adults and two kids age 6&2. Its location is just in the prime location as compare to the others hotel in the resort. There is a wonder man made sand beach you know ur kids are safe from the waves at the same time enjoy building sand castles. The designated pool facilities are also wonder for all ages you can just easily spend one whole day there for family bonding. Rooms are clean with pull out bed and a balcony for us, its a open concept wardrobe with shower and toilets together. Its kind of restricted space in the shower to help shower the kids.

Hard Rock Hotel Singapore,"Nice stay, not really ""Hard Rock feel""","i spent 2 nights at this hotel while traveling for business. The room was beautiful, very spacious and modern, with all the amenities and a great bed. The room itself as well as common spaces were very clean. Not sure about the hotel's restaurant, as we had breakfast at the hotel's conference center as part of the conference we attended. What we had there did not live up to expectations, as it was too Asian-oriented with very few choices for European visitors, but maybe the breakfast menu was tailored to conference attendees and things are better at the main restaurant... The pool was nice (I did not have time to use it) and the hotel's location was very near on foot to the area were all the cafes and restaurants are situated.

Hard Rock Hotel Singapore,Ok only for a 5 star resort,"The room is comfortable; the air conditioning is very cold and the shower is great, esp the rain shower. There isn't a bathtub which isn't a huge deal. The swimming pool is amazing and great for kids. The location is excellent. Very close to universal studios and adventure cove. My only gripe with this place is the staff. I've stayed in a number of 5 star resorts and the staff are normally very accommodating. A few staff that work here seem to be very unhappy - eg questioning whether we actually lived in the hotel when asking for pool towels when she typed in the wrong room number followed by a condescending comment about room charges if we don't return the towel; counting the towels on return... Operator questioning the need for additional towels or water..

Beaches, cable car everything in door step. Decor and design is of typical Hardrock standard - lovely and well maintained. Pool fantastic and biggest asset of hotel. Bedrooms lovely, with comfiest beds and linen going. Did not have the same atmosphere as other Hardrock hotels - no bands/ live music , very quiet hotel and memorabilia substandard. If I could describe what u mean - it's like Hardrock have built and designed the hotel and handed it over to Santosa resort to run. The little things like ""have a rocking day"" was missing.

You could kindly inform us so that it's up to us whether we would like to stay there. I told front desk about this and they say that I can cancel my booking and book next time. Woah.. So I come as you say and I go as you wish? We stayed for 2 nights and we don't just waste our time because you failed to let your hotel guest know what's happening in the hotel.

Hard Rock Hotel Singapore,"Terrible, don't bother, stay somewhere else.","We arrived with my extended family of 6 adults, 5 kids, asked for adjoining rooms, which we requested weeks in advance, as our 5 kids are very young. We were allocated rooms pretty far away from each other with no note of our request on arrival. After 45mins at check in, and a few tense words, we got 2 rooms together and the other rooms spread out with a promise if you come down to reception tomorrow, we will see what we could do. In the morning, the breakfast's were total chaos, huge queues just to get in, nowhere to sit, there are 3 ppl deep at each food station, with hungry ppl that look like they haven't eaten in a week, I felt like I was at a Metallica concert, not enjoyable at all.

Hard Rock Hotel Singapore,My favourite RWS hotel.,"I stayed at Equarius Hotel for my first night and then Hard Rock Hotel for my second. Having been to Hard Rock Hotel thrice before, I am very familiar with the hotel; and as a former rocker myself, I love it! The grungy feel of rock extends throughout every inch of the hotel. Pros: The lobby has had a makeover and it looks so big and spacious now. Rooms are pretty basic, nothing special, but the boutique feel of guitar art and celebrity memorabilia are cleverly placed to make it feel classy. I requested for a baby cot without prior booking and it was delivered in 5 minutes. Service was great from everyone. Concierge staff were really pleasant and offered my family a buggy ride to Equarius Hotel where I have had a pre-planned access to Adventure Cove.

Hard Rock Hotel Singapore,"Worst ""5 star"" hotel ever!!!",Overall it was a good trip but man Hard Rock Sentosa Island is the worst hotel i have stayed in. The room wasnt even made up properly when we checked in (there was someone else's rubbish left behind in the shower). Staff doesnt greet or smile at you when you walk past. No clear instructions given on how to use their free wifi. Wifi is only ONE BAR in our room and keeps disconnecting and is very slow. Claims to be a 5 star hotel but is nothing up to expectation. The only reason why i gave a 2 star rating is because of the look of the hotel as well as the staff at the pool bar and the gift shop at the lobby. They were amazing and it was great customer service while everyone else works with a sulky face.

Hard Rock Hotel Singapore,Hard Rock - disappointing service standards,"Queued for 1 HOUR AND 20 mins standing , just to check in. There should be more counter staff to manage during the sch holiday period. As a 5 star hotel , i was shocked by the poor service standards. The front office staff were trying their best to serve as efficient as possible. The management staff should step forward and while waiting , offered complimentary drinks during peak periods so that waiting could be more tolerable. Other then that, everything was ok. Thus I hope that if the managment team could monitor and manage the unreasonable long waiting time of standing in the queue while being served during peak hrs. Then it will do justice to guests who are paying premium rates to book the hotel and will think twice about goin back.

Hard Rock Hotel Singapore,Terrible terrible hotel.,Would never stay here again. There are so many issues that I feel the only way to address the problems is to replace upper management. The toilets in the room offer no privacy. They are the same as toilets you get in shopping malls. You can't get out of the shower withoit other people in the room being able to walk past and see you. There is filthy grime all around the edge of the sink. The rooms had a musty smell that never went away. The hallways smell of cigarette smoke all the time. They charged a huge amount for a terrible breakfast. There are hand prints on the walls of the bathroom that already to be some type of resin or glue that cannot be removed.

Hard Rock Hotel Singapore,Bad Stay,"I am writing this review sitting on the floor in lobby as there are not enough seats. This hotel fails in many ways. Having travelled lots to SE Asia and always choosing 5 star hotels , let me say this is not - 3 stars at best. The location is good , right near universal studios but that is were it stops. The room was a disgrace , something I would find in an Ibis or 3 star hotel in Australia. Twin beds and a small round table , no couch, no chairs the worst room I have ever stayed in. Who has a bathroom with no door , yep no door and staying here with my daughter #awkward........ While I'm on the bathroom the towels were thread bear something I would dry my dogs with not myself...... and no shampoo or soaps etc , just a pump pack - yuk !!!! so 3 star.

Hard Rock Hotel Singapore,Hard Time,"Poor consideration and service for early check-ins. The Front Office staff and the Resort Manager seemed to be least affected with the agony faced by guests waiting to check in early. After all the begging and pleading, I finally got my room almost after 4 hours of waiting. The mini-bar was empty and there was a 45 minute wait for anything that u request for from the in-room dining or the concierge as unabashedly conveyed by the staff over the phone. The presentation and the quality of the food delivered through the in-room dining felt like it was delivered out of 3 star kitchen as I received the salt and pepper in cling wrapped bowls instead of sachets or salt pepper shakers.

Hard Rock Hotel Singapore,"An average hotel, with average service, but above average prices","I will summarise first; the hotel is reasonable. It is definitely conveniently located if you want to explore the Sentosa resort offerings. Now for some details: Check-in: Got there at 13:30 and to be fair check-in time did say 3pm, told to come back. Came back at 14:58, and again told the room not ready and please come back later. When I said I would be back in 2 mins at 3pm, a room suddenly became ready. The room: Reasonable size, but very sparse and the wi-fi didn't really work in the room. For some reason the bathroom doesn't have a door, which was fine because I was by myself but might be an issue depending who you're staying with. Also the room had extremely noisy A/C, and an almost as noisy fuse box in the wardrobe that hummed like crazy, I had to put the A/C on",3 out of 5,April 2017,5.0 of 5 stars,#14 of 16 hotels in Sentosa Island,0.08564814814814811,0.40740740740740744,54.282407407407405,40.74074074074075,8.564814814814811,Location
Hard Rock Hotel Singapore,Very Average with a Few Issues,"Checked in with the family, and had two rooms booked. Arrived early around 1030 after a long flight and appreciated that rooms may not be ready. Hence we explored Sentosa a bit, and had some lunch, but were shocked to find that by 1430 only one of two rooms were ready. When we went to the room, the cleaners advised that they had another room to finish before they would even start our second room and hence there was no way it would even have been ready by 1500. I would have expected some priority. Then we had a few room cleanliness issues: we were greeted by crunching Pringles on the floor and then could not believe the degree of moulding in the bathroom sink. There was also hair in the toilet.

The pool has water guns and other equipment which children between 2 and 10 will love 3. Good amenities when you want to unwind at the hotel 3.

The rooms are tired - ours had a partly painted ceiling and chips out of the walls. The bathroom was clean and well appointed. Housekeeping was timely and efficient. The breakfast on offer was poor quality and seriously overpriced - even by Singapore standards. The best part of the hotel used to be the pool - a sprawling, meandering, tropical paradise: it's why we booked here both times. But now they are ""upgrading"" it, as you will read on their website.

Hard Rock Hotel Singapore,Disappointed,We wanted to treat the our Daughters to a staycation and had been wanting to try the hard rock hotel for years. However we felt like we were continually waiting in queues- it took 20 minutes just to wait in a queue before someone at Reception could check us in.

The pool is big and our son loved it. Check in was slow. The first room we checked into was just... damp. Water streaks running down the walls and a really musty smell.

No tub - just a shower - which is sometimes hard if you're bringing really little ones. The wifi strength wasn't great. They were obviously very concerned about pool towels disappearing because you had to check them in and out. The pool area was really nice but could have been kept a little cleaner.

Rooms are OK, not well suited to business travelers despite there being a conference center downstairs - lack of work desk and outlets. Gym is not great unless you like cardio. Free weights go to 20 kgs and there is one “cable type” machine. Drinks at the bar expensive, but there are other options nearby. Towels seem to be rationed in the rooms and you need to check in/out at the pool.

Hard Rock Hotel Singapore,Good option to stay within Sentosa,"Two things that work for this Hotel is their Pool and the location within Sentosa .. Rest everything else leaves u wanting more .. We stayed in Hard Rock for 4 days and had opted for breakfast as a part of package itself, but found it quite a waste .. The spread wasnt great and being vegetarians we hardly had any options beyond cereals, toast and fruits ! Also the restaurant felt more like a company canteen, breakfast felt more functional and less of an experience. The service too was very transaction, so no special scores for hospitality .. Indians can step out of the hotel and walk to Restaurant Samundra for Indian food (its right outside the hotel entry), also an option of taking free metro to Vivocity mall (5 mins away) for a south indian meal at Sarvana Bhawan ..

Hard Rock Hotel Singapore,AVOID if you expect '5 star'.,"I am currently staying at this hotel. I have so many words about this hotel, but the best I can sum it up as right now - is just embarrassing. We moved from a fantastic 4 star hotel (thats half the price) in Orchard Road to Hard Rock, expecting a recognisable increase in Quality and experience. What a shock. I came here undercover on business, and this experience will have ramifications on their conference and events area. While we were here, my partner had his 30th birthday. It was nice they provided a cake, but considering I detailed ahead of time in an email whose birthday it was, it would have been nice if they could have at least got the details right and understood it was his birthday (as per the email)- not mine.

Hard Rock Hotel Singapore,The small things,"Comparing Hard Rock hotel. Sentosa, to Hard Rock hotel Bali.. Quite similar but it's the small things that make the difference between a great holiday and a good one. The lack of shelving, or storage was frustrating. The in room wifi was hit and miss. The main restaurant (Sessions) was a seafood restaurant and very little options to cater for a wider range of foods. Breakfast was on par with other HR iN Bali. One tiny shelf in the shower was not large enough to place afamilies worth of shower items and had to left on the sink. Only placing 2 coffee and tea sachels per day was not enough. HR Bali had a minimum of 4-6 and always topped up. Money exchange was limited to 300 a day/time at reception. HR Bali had its own exchange with unlimited amount. The good/ok..

Hard Rock Hotel Singapore,Good location.,"We booked via RWS website with Mastercard Promotion. With this package includes tickets to 3 attactions: Adventure Cove, USS and Sea Aquarium. Unfortunately, breakfast is not included but this was not a problem for us as there are lots of cafes around Sentosa. We arrived around 2:30pm which is before the official check-in and the available room is only with twin bed. We opted for king bed so we have to wait after 3pm for the room with this bed to be available. They allowed us to keep our luggages while we wait. At exactly 3pm, glad that finally the room is available. Luggages were sent by Ariel which has been so friendly and kind to orient us with our room.

Hard Rock Hotel Singapore,"Excellent location, big rooms, family friendly ... and the pool!","Checked in for a staycation for my family of 10. Requested for 4 rooms with connecting doors. Granted without an issue. All rooms were on the same floor and had excellent views of the harbour from our 6th floor windows. We selected HRH for its proximity to USS and most of the other facilities and restaurants in RWS. With my mom hard on walking, this was indeed a good choice. What I really like about the rooms are the generous size and huge beds. Have to mention that there is no door to the toilet which will give rise to serious consideration if you are sharing room with someone. Love the little touches such as the guitar shaped amenities box and guitar-embroiled pillow cases. The stay will never be complete without using its pools.

Hard Rock Hotel Singapore,Stunning Experience!,"It was actually First time being in Sentosa to celebrate my friend's anniversary. We were quite exhausted from a prior trip so we decided to have a few drinks in Hard Rock's lobby bar. The place was laid back and had a great view of the hotel's amenities. What really captured my attention is the hospitality of the bartenders plus the kind of drinks they have served us.

Hard Rock Hotel Singapore,Great if you have infants / small children,"We really liked the hotel and staff. Especially the pool bar and indoor bar staff. But actually all the staff were friendly and helpful. The breakfast is a buffet and OK. Mainly eastern cuisine but also eggs and bacon. The main restaurant Sessions is more like a canteen type environment but there are quite a few outside eateries. The main thing is that the hotel was inundated with small, out of control, children. Maybe it's a cultural thing but a lobby full of screaming or screeching children is not fun. And the pool. Not a one off but every day. Bizarre. Even the hotel corridors sounded like thousands of kids. So, if you have very young kids then it is fine.

Hard Rock Hotel Singapore,Good family stay,"We have been here many times. This must be our 4th stay this year and prob 8th all up. They have renovated or rather concreted up the deep landscape pool and also the smaller rock pools. Perhaps due to some drownings and close shaves. They have also made the sand pool a lot more shallow. So this is great if u have young kids. The hotel is good for families as the pool has. A slide, fountains plus sand area of kids. The room service is okay. Used to be much better, ie similar to Hard Rock Cafe standards but not anymore. Staff are pleasant enough and this is a suitable hotel so long as you're not after top notch luxury. Don't ask for a room with balcony if you want a daybed by the window which can be used to sleep a kid.

Hard Rock Hotel Singapore,Amazing. Wish we'd stayed longer,"My husband and I stayed here for one night and was left wanting more. Upon entering the hotel you are greeted with upbeat energy and music, which was the opposite from the hotel we just came from. It was the perfect vacation vibe. The room was bright and clean. I definitely recommend getting a BALCONY room even if you have to get two beds. Seeing the pool and hearing the energy from the people brought the energy to our room. But if you are looking for more quiet than maybe don't get a poolside view or ask for a higher room. The pool was AWESOME and the music was playing regardless if there was 3 people or 20 people, which made us feel comfortable when we were the only ones there. Clearly they care about everyone's fun experience at the pool.

It's a short walk down the stairs to the Forum - where there are tons of restaurants, a food court, ice cream, a 7-11. Next door is a waterpark. One day we went to the water park, stopped at Din Tai Fung to put our name on the waiting list, walked up to our hotel to shower and change, then walked back down in perfect time for lunch! It's also a short walk to the Merlion Station (which is beautiful), and then walkable (think lots of shaded escalators) to the Sentosa Station.

It would have been great to have service around the pool on the pool lounges,4 out of 5,April 2018,5.0 of 5 stars,#14 of 16 hotels in Sentosa Island,0.24567857142857147,0.6447261904761905,62.28392857142857,64.47261904761905,24.567857142857147,Amenities
Hard Rock Hotel Singapore,Have stayed in better Hard Rock's... Still good though,"Great hotel and pool and a shout out to the guys at the pool bar who were great. I love staying at Hard Rock's and the kids enjoy it too. Only got 4 rather than 5 stars because I found the room service menu to be limited, they would make up the room and leave dirty plates, also the breakfast was overpriced and very average in my opinion. Great location though and plenty of places to eat nearby and walking distance to Universal Studios etc. Will stay again for sure and take advantage of the location for our meals.",4 out of 5,April 2018,5.0 of 5 stars,#14 of 16 hotels in Sentosa Island,0.22015873015873014,0.6036177248677249,61.00793650793651,60.361772486772495,22.015873015873012,Amenities
Hard Rock Hotel Singapore,Find a better hotel!,"I was expecting a nicer room, but the room was quite mediocre. Maybe a rock themed room, but it was altogether boring. The room was small for SGD 350 per night. I remember Hotel Carlton's room was larger than this! There seems to be scarce staff to help around. The concierge was shouting at kids to keep quiet too. The bartender was horrible - Cheng Ming. He treated us as if we were asking for free drinks during happy hour. Very bad service. It says buy 1 and free 1 during happy hour but when we asked him he said he already poured double shots into the drink??? This was not specified earlier. Even to refill the chips it was such a pain for him and his painassed face. I don't think this is the way paying guests should be treated. Have some respect.

Hard Rock Hotel Singapore,Clean Spacious Room with a very relaxing pool,"We had a room on Level 6 (highest floor) that oversees Adventure Cove and we get to see dolphins in action from a distance. Room is very big and even with two super-single beds, there's still a huge space to walk around and even have dinner there. Swimming pool is so relaxing - it feels like a beach in there. There is a pool bar that offers happy hour from 12pm to 6pm (one for one Beer ;) and a jacuzzi area too. The bad - the TV in the room is so small in such a big room, we had difficulty looking at the subtitles or name of the show & place is not very secure in my opinion.. 1.

Hard Rock Hotel Singapore,Great hotel,"Just stayed here with our 4yr old. Our kingsize bed had a roll away bed under it where she slept on. There are extra blanket and pillow in the closet but júst for an extra sheet they charge 70 dollar per night!! We were shocked as we travel around a lot with her and this was the first hotel that wanted to charge so much. The room itself was already crazy expensive. Besides the above we did had an awesome time. The room is spacious with view over the city and dolphins of the waterpark next door. The walk in bathroom is great, with a nice rainshower. The bed is sooo comfi it was hard to get out. We did not include breakfast as the price is crazy high!! There is plenty of food around the hotel. The pool is also awesome.

The hotel has a gym where adults can go for some workout while the children can be in the Kids Club room to have some fun and taken care of by hotel staff. Its location is convenient, just walk down and you have access to lots of F & B, even if it’s the wee hours. USS, SEA Aquarium, Adventure Cove etc is just a walk away too.

Hard Rock Hotel Singapore,Very nice hotel to stay at,I really enjoy staying at this Hotel. We stayed here for the end of our Singapore trip for 4 nights after a week on Orchard and we also stayed here for a few nights 5 years ago - although at that time I was disappointed with check in and how they rang you constantly despite the do not contact button pushed to see if you wanted the room cleaned - we were very jet lagged and just wanted to be left alone. This time we were with our 3 year old son. They gave us a king bed with a pull out single mattress that came from under the king. Its location is great right outside the Forum and Universal Studios.

My 5yr old is on a trundle where no doonar was supplied. We turn on the tv, however there are no movies.

Hard Rock Hotel Singapore,location matters,was quite hesitant to book this hotel after seeing other reviews. I was glad that I made the choice. Location is close to attraction. Room is spacious with its own living room plus a big bath tub where you can soak after a humid Singapore weather. will come back again and definitely book this suite.,4 out of 5,October 2018,5.0 of 5 stars,#14 of 16 hotels in Sentosa Island,0.1625,0.49583333333333335,58.12500000000001,49.583333333333336,16.25,Location
