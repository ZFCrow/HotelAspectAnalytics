JW Marriott Hotel Singapore South Beach,One of the best hotels in Singapore!,Most travellers to singapore prefer the marina bay sands for the hype but if you want true hospitality jw marriott south beach can offer in abundance! From early check in to a greaf breakfast to even helping out on getting back something i lost in a taxi. Thats the extent of effort they put! Breakfast is very global covering cuisines from around the world and the place is beaming with happy vibes! The place to stay if you plan on travelling to singapore.

JW Marriott Hotel Singapore South Beach,Great addition to the Marriott brand in Singapore!,"Modern designs by Philippe Starck, huge complex with numerous top-quality FNB establishments and strategic location, this property breathes fresh air for Marriott members (prior to merger) who were tired with Marriott Tangs on Orchard. Accessible to different parts of the city with multiple entrances and direct sheltered access to train stations - it provides great convenience for explorers of the lion city. Try the wonderful Madame Fan restaurant that serves Chinese/Cantonese food but remember to visit the bar prior to entry that resembles the Orient Express/Belmond train!

The service in the Lounge was fantastic, Chef John, Olive and the bar staff became almost friends in the couple weeks that I stayed at the JW. They made a long business trip not only bearable, but fun. They were always happy to talk, help with anything and suggest things to do over the weekend.

JW Marriott Hotel Singapore South Beach,"Amazing staff, great location","This review is long overdue. I joined my husband on his business trip to Singapore- my first time visiting, his second. The hotel was clean, with a very modern feel. The staff were amazing. From Hai Yang in housekeeping to Hazel and Melvin in the Executive Lounge- every staff member we interacted with was friendly and helpful. Hai Yang went above and beyond when cleaning our room, Hazel had great suggestions for places to visit, and Melvin made wonderful drinks. I loved the location- being across from SunTec made it very easy to catch the MRT, a bus, or call a Grab to go out and see the city. It was also great to have such a wide variety of shopping options so close so we could pick up anything we forgot (and some kaya from Ya-Kun for friends and family back home).",5 out of 5,November 2019,5.0 of 5 stars,#25 of 372 hotels in Singapore,0.3478125,0.5327083333333335,67.390625,53.27083333333334,34.78125,Services
JW Marriott Hotel Singapore South Beach,Great Location Outstanding Service,"The location of the Hotel is ideal in the Marina Bay district, the dining options were plentiful and we had great meals there. Our room was spacious and clean with outstanding views of the harbor. They have this unique NCO club which I think is relatively new with Bars and restaurants attached to the property. The best part of this JW Marriott was the executive lounge. The service and food and beverage options were amazing. Miss Stella Lim, Jacquelyn, Hazel and Camilla were all wonderful to us for our entire stay.

JW Marriott Hotel Singapore South Beach,Great but too expensive.,"We stayed at this hotel for two nights over the New Year’s Eve celebration. First I must note that we loved how modern the hotel is. The disco lights in the lifts, the decor and most importantly the toilets in the room! Once you experience those toilets - there’s no going back. You would know what I mean once you stay there :) We stayed in a lounge access room and it felt very spacious with modern finishes. Although the carpet on the floor looked a bit worn with strings hanging out of it. Not a great look! We had a semi ok view facing the suntec city shopping centre and a bit of the Marina. I was a bit disappointed by that as I thought paying $800 a night would have had better views. But whatever... Wasn’t going to let it spoil our stay. Staff are very friendly.

JW Marriott Hotel Singapore South Beach,"Absolutely amazing hotel, staff, and location. You gotta stay here.","I stayed at the JW Marriott South Beach for 4 nights in December. As a Platinum Elite member I was very impressed with the hotel's genuine interest in accommodating preferred guests. I checked in using the Bonvoy app and noticed that I had been upgraded to an Executive Club King from a deluxe room. I was grateful for the upgrade but based on my review of TripAdvisor reviews, there had been some complaints about the size of these lower end rooms. I texted the hotel via the app to see if perhaps I could be put in a corner room or the ""Premier King Larger Guest room"".

JW Marriott Hotel Singapore South Beach,A JW as you would expect it,I think that it is the latest Marriott property in Singapore. And it fits up to the standard as I wish from a JW brand hotel. As the Marriott Tang Plaza is a bit outdated I would recommend this one as my new Marriott default hotel in Singapore. A bit stylish in design and has everything you need. Location is in the Suntec area so close by to everything. A bit of downside is the pool that seems to be a bit small. But I didn't have time for swimming anyway.

From the moment you arrive and walk through the very generously proportioned foyer that has a super relaxed feel, to the staff who are highly professional and friendly - and lots of them around to assist all of the time. We had a suite with sep lounge on the 17th floor, incredible views overlooking the Singapore Cricket Club and the Raffles Hotel. Marina Bay Sands also visible. Also had a twin room for our daughters aged 17 & 20 which was on level 6. Love the contemporary decor and space- high ceilings, huge bathroom and separate foyer and powder room.

JW Marriott Hotel Singapore South Beach,Staycation with fireworks!💥,"This hotel is one of the newest in this location, so it was immaculate and modern. Only downside were the pillows. They were too soft or too hard. Strange why they got those type of pillows for such a luxury hotel. I got the room with the Marina Bay View which I highly recommend. Just top up slightly in the rates to get a fantastic day and night view of the city. We were very fortunate that there was fireworks during that night and for a full view of the spectacle from the comfort of our room! There is a pool on the 18th level. This was quite underwhelming as it was short in length and only 1.2m deep. But it does provide a breathtaking open view of the city. Good for Instagrammable photos of cos.

Unlike other hotels we've been to the past, Melvin encouraged us to take the drinks from the fridge for our consumption in the room. As an Ambassador member, we were upgraded to the Deluxe Junior Suite facing the Marina Bay - a spectacular view, and they even returned our 2 Suite Night Awards as they could not offer the best available room at that time.

The bathroom was nice however. The lounge offering variety was spectacular. Spoiled for choice in the mornings and the evenings.

The personnel is beating all previous service experiences I had. The exec lounge is great but on the low floor level (2). This is a little drawback from the 70th floor view of the Swiss. However, the JW Marriott exec lounge has a better suited in my opinion, bar area with giant screen conducive to great conversation. The swimming pool is just awesome at the 18th floor wit a breath taking view of Marina Bay and downtown SG. A little drawback is in the bathrooms.

Perhaps due to the lesser number of guests, staffs are much more polite and obliging, although on both occasions, they were always professional in their interactions. We had better interactions with staff this time as they showed personal care and concern, asking us how are we doing and chatting about the Covid19 situation.

The hotel was already well prepared with all the temperature checks etc. Check-in was smooth, balloons and cake, personalised note was made placed in the room after coming back from dinner. My only main gripe was the framed art in the room, it's a bit scary to sleep facing it at night. Breakfast buffet spread the next morning seemed rather limited, not sure if that's the usual spread. The staff came over with a birthday cake again and sang a birthday song - only to my horror that the addressed me - 'Mandy/Wendy' and weren't sure of my name, likewise on the birthday card.

JW Marriott Hotel Singapore South Beach,Quarantined for 14 days,Great service from hotel staff. Food was catered by the Singapore govt and became rather repetitive the worst being the breakfast. The only issue I would bring up is that I was a bit disappointed by the quality of the finishings of the room. For example the quality of the floor tiles and the sinks were not quite what I expected of a JW Marriott. There were also bits of dried instant noodle hidden under crevices on the floor which the cleaning staff missed from the previous occupant. But the customer service was top notch- well done,4 out of 5,September 2020,5.0 of 5 stars,#25 of 372 hotels in Singapore,-0.11944444444444446,0.5347222222222222,44.02777777777778,53.47222222222222,11.944444444444446,Services

Given the circumstances, the cancellation is probably beyond their control.

JW Marriott Hotel Singapore South Beach,Best Christmas Eve 2020,Celebrated Christmas Eve in JW Marriott at South Beach and it was amazing ❤️❤️❤️. The view was breathtaking both in the evening and morning☀️. Check in was a breeze and holiday vibes was really there. It's in the central area and most bars/restaurants are just walking distance. A staycation is not complete without a relaxing day at the spa. I highly commend Ms Shaa and Ms Terry for making us feel welcome and I really felt recharged and relaxed after. ❤️☺️ Can't wait to go back and do another staycation.

JW Marriott Hotel Singapore South Beach,A Forgettable Experience,"With an impressive architecture and being a relatively new kid in the block, have always wanted to try. Overall a decent experience but not memorable that warrants a return visit. Room was spacious and modern. As a platinum member, there was no welcome amenity (and nothing in mini bar) and late check out was only offered till 2pm (acknowledging that it’s subjected to availability). Was given lounge access but lounge food was nothing impressive though service standard made up for the experience.

Location is super convenient, an easy walk from city hall and to the marina Bay Area. Highly recommend getting a slot for the pool - gorgeous views across the bay.

The Experience Spa package was worth every penny, you get 2 complimentary massages included and breakfast for 2, along with your room. Honestly, the package costs as much as 2 massages in a typical 5 star hotel spa, so from that angle you're pretty much paying for 2 massages and getting a room along with it.

JW Marriott Hotel Singapore South Beach,Premium prize - budget hotel experience,"I have stayed several hundreds of nights in Marriott group hotels. My understanding is that Courtyard is the lower end, Marriott is one step better and JW Marriott is the highest level. All these hotels are nice. This hotel although named as JW Marriott doesn't reach the Courtyard level and it brings nothing of the Marriott style and experience. Let me explain why. Hotel lobby is not welcoming it is strangely shaped and the decoration is not aesthetic, secondly you enter the lift and get lightshow and the lift definitely doesn't have enough light, just irritating changing colors. I started to wonder if this hotel is meant for young clientele? Then the room itself - I have stayed in budget hotels and some of the hotel chains use pre-installed modules that are just assembled on",1 out of 5,February 2021,5.0 of 5 stars,#25 of 372 hotels in Singapore,0.11500000000000003,0.45499999999999996,55.75,45.49999999999999,11.500000000000004,General

Upon check in, Ms Jusanna who attended to us was super polite & very professional. Upon request, we were upgraded to the city view room as a birthday goodwill gesture. Made my stay even more enjoyable. The overall experience during my stay was awesome. BUT wish to feedback the breakfast selection. Can’t help to feel underwhelmed(not the selection of food) but the fact that we can only order the menu set ONCE. Personally feel the items available for repeat order is nothing to shout about(service of the staff was very good) Of course I blame COVID 19 for this.

Bathrobes felt very luxurious which I was grateful for.

The automated curtains and blinds were not working, fortunately the curtains were closed as the room I was on was facing a little garden (only accessible by staff at the moment). The deluxe room came with a bath tub which is one of the differences compared to the studio room. Hotel staff were friendly and accommodated to our request to stay in the main building.

Check in and check out process was fuss free. Booking of breakfast and pool usage was easy as well - just had to link up w the hotel’s wifi. Pool’s view was amazing. Location of hotel is GREAT. I walked everywhere from Esplanade MRT or just across the street to Suntec/Bugis etc. Cons: breakfast was sadly lacking. Service wasn’t prompt (perhaps due to lack of manpower or too many guests). Food was bland.

JW Marriott Hotel Singapore South Beach,This second hotel quarantine was even better,"Given the circumstances (hotel quarantine required for all people returning to Singapore) I must say that I was really lucky with the JW Marriott South Beach. I had a good room with a great bed. The food provided was diverse and mostly delicious. The in-room dining against extra charge was excellent. The service very attentive. This is my second SHN. Last year I also stayed at a premium hotel from the Accor group (other side of the road...). I must say this stay was all in all a little better (sorry my friends from Accor - I also love staying with you 😉).

JW Marriott Hotel Singapore South Beach,14-day quarantine,"This is my first ever review of a hotel. I felt compelled to write this because my wife and infant child were in quarantine with me and I had really hoped for a hotel & room allocation that was clean and well maintained. I’m not sure if it’s because of the budget cuts due to the covid-19 pandemic or that my expectations of a JW Marriott managed hotel are unrealistic. The hotel claims that an enhanced cleaning is performed after each guest checks out. Either the room that my family & I were allocated to have not received guests for a long time, or no enhanced cleaning of the room was conducted. The condition of the room, the general hygiene levels and the amenities are in dire need of maintenance/repair and a deep cleaning.

The highlight of my stay is really the lounge team, who greeted me by my name and made small chat every evening. Refills of the canapes were also never too much to ask for. On a separate note, I also did an express 30mins massage, which was excellent. Just a note that the express spa services do not grant excess to the spa facilities (jacuzzi and steam room). If I have to nitpick on my stay, that would be the absence of nepresso machine in the premier room (only instant coffee sachet). I reckon only the club executive rooms come with nepresso machines.

The decor in the public areas is design inspired and pleasant enough, but not outstanding. The room - which was supposed to be an upgrade from the deluxe room - was disappointing. The layout was odd, not comfortable, with a (too) large bathro and corridor but limited sleeping area. The fittings looked worn too, surprising for a relatively new hotel. The remote was non responsive and the buttons sticky.

JW Marriott Hotel Singapore South Beach,Best quarantine experience so far,"I’m one of those very unfortunate people who have had to travel multiple times during these pandemic years. This is my fourth quarantine, so I’m very used to long stays in hotel rooms. Having that experience does not guarantee a good stay, however. Where you are stuck for two weeks can make a tremendous difference in how well you weather the storm. So if, like me, you’re going to be stuck anywhere for two weeks, may I suggest the JW Marriott? The nearly floor-to-ceiling windows provide a literal and metaphorical window into the world so that you don’t feel so isolated during your stay. The menu was carefully crafted, and I will genuinely miss some of the delicious food I’ve had here.

The room has a suberb bathroom design; isolated spacious shower with waterfall showerhead, state of the art Toto toilet with auto features, a large and deep bathtub and great open design. Lovely large bed and automatic curtain features. Plenty of storage space. Now the negatives. For such a highly thought of brand like Marriott and a new hotel with modern design the television is very small. I don't necessarily mind but it is incongruent with the room's features. The most significant issue is the meal situation",2 out of 5,August 2021,5.0 of 5 stars,#25 of 372 hotels in Singapore,0.1638744588744589,0.5089403778040142,58.193722943722946,50.894037780401426,16.38744588744589,Cleaniness

The room itself was spacious and I felt absolutely comfortable in my 2 weeks here. An added bonus was that I could see the fireworks of the National Day Parade from my window! The meals were always quite delicious, although some meals were a little lacking in quantity. What stood out to me was the exceptional service provided by the staff at JW Marriott. The check-in process was smooth, with staff explaining clearly and politely all I needed to know for my stay. Care packages delivered by my family were always delivered to me speedily.

Their service was always cheerful, prompt, and thoughtful. This hotel would have had a 5-star review if not for two things which made my 14-day quarantine stay almost unbearable: Musty smells in the room. Singapore is a very humid place and if you’re not careful with ventilation and climate control, there is the unavoidable problem of mold and mildew. The room had very generous closet space, usually a lifesaver for such a long stay. Alas, the closets smelled very musty and had visible white mildew growth on the surfaces. I ended up wiping down the closets with a cleaner spray. I am quite allergic to mold spores, was on allergy meds the entire length of my stay, but still",3 out of 5,September 2021,5.0 of 5 stars,#25 of 372 hotels in Singapore,0.09817460317460316,0.5331349206349206,54.90873015873016,53.31349206349206,9.817460317460316,Cleaniness

Maybe is quarantine hotel now so you can see got a lot food stains on carpet. Talking about quarantine you may need assistance from the hotel. The good thing about it is you can use the room phone to call and also have a whatsapp acc call “ At Your Service “ , however the service may disappoint you. When you request some replenish like toilet paper/ teabags etc you may need keep checking with them. The worst part is make me felt like I begged for it. When you request certain items at the same time they won’t send all you need. Example you call and request toilet paper,teabags and towels, end up just send the towels to you.

We were fortunate to have Mable to assist us with planning our wedding. She was very responsive and patient despite our many questions.

We do commend her professionalism and ability to handle changing situations especially with organising a wedding during the Covid pandemic. Aside from the extremely beautiful architecture of the Grand Ballroom itself, the people behind the scenes including Thana (Banquet IC), Eugene (AV) and many others from the JW team worked together to create a magical experience for us and our guests.

JW Marriott Hotel Singapore South Beach,Great experience at the JW Marriott,"Stayed here as a couple in December 2021. The hotel had just reopened after being used for SHN and was running a very attractive promotion. Hotel allowed early check in from 11am which was a plus. Rooms overall were okay. Slightly on the smaller side with some signs of wear. Desk is placed right in front of the bed and TV hence don't expect to get work done and have someone watch TV at the same time. However when we got to our room, we noticed a used ART swab lodged in the seat cushion. We raised this to the front desk as feedback and they were very apologetic and offered a room change. Overall we were satisfied with their service recovery, especially front desk staff Jerry who we were particularly impressed with.

JW Marriott Hotel Singapore South Beach,Great exterior undone by some odd interior design flaws,Sir Norman Foster's architectural tour de force is quite undone by whoever did the interior design. I stayed in a suite which had great views of the padang but it seems that the interior designer must not have thought much of the views - he or she put a huge block with a TV in it right in front of the window in the living room. Fortunately the bedroom have great views with it being a corner as does the bathroom. Opening the bathroom door should be included as one of the 12 tasks of Hercules! It is not for the faint hearted or weak of body - requiring a Herculean task.

JW Marriott Hotel Singapore South Beach,One of the best in Singapore,"We stayed at the hotel for 8 days during this trip and it was the best out of the 3 hotels that we stayed at. The hotel is amazingly located, with the Civic District and Raffles City mall within walking distance. Arguably the best location to be to learn more about Singapore’s history and how far it’s come. Personally, it beats staying near Orchard Road, which is only a few MRT stops away. This hotel is vibrant and well designed. You feel a sense of energy being in the common areas. Our Premier room was spacious, with a massive toilet. Breakfast was amazing with a huge spread everyday. I particularly liked the noodle/laksa station.

I have stayed in many Marriott hotels and I must say this is one of the most disappointing. It is a pity that the room was a great let down to an otherwise marvellous stay.,4 out of 5,August 2022,5.0 of 5 stars,#25 of 372 hotels in Singapore,0.2296296296296296,0.5725925925925927,61.48148148148148,57.25925925925927,22.96296296296296,Services

Staff were friendly, rooms are clean and all seems to be organized. Good equipped gym and nice view from the outdoor place at the 18th floor. The only point I find disappointing is the pool. There is one on the 18th without any deck chair but only some wooden benches which reminds me on the school swimming pool. There is a second pool in the building next door (east tower) which you can reach via a bridge. Large area (ok size pool for a city hotel) but very unpractical designed.

JW Marriott Hotel Singapore South Beach,First impressions,Just arrived. Looks like a nice hotel and everyone welcoming. As an Ambassador Elite was upgraded to a family room however since it is my sister and I preferred two beds (sorry but not interested in sleeper sofa). Only rooms were normal (premium twin beds). It’s disappointing that a hotel this size doesn’t offer two doubles or queens. Hoped for a high floor with a view but no luck there. Executive lounge looks nice and everyone is very smiling and accommodating. Will update as trip progresses in facilities. They recommend a reservation for breakfast or take your chances as a walk in.

We had reason to speak to management during our stay but they couldn’t be bothered to follow up or return our call.

JW Marriott Hotel Singapore South Beach,Almost great if they start it off right.,The JW is definitely one of the more unique properties in Singapore. When you have the likes of Marina Bay Sands nearby you would think it would be hard to compete but JW offers a compelling enough stay to warrant a look. We had a suite booked for the duration of our stay over the new years. Unfortunately the stay started off on a sour note when we were told our room was not ready despite us arriving well past 3pm checkin. Not what you would expect from a premium suite experience. This coupled with over an hour wait did not kick off the right atmosphere. That said the rest of the stay was smooth and enjoyable. The pool and views from the suites are some of the best in SG.

JW Marriott Hotel Singapore South Beach,JW Marriott Singapore South Beach - Major pluses,"We stayed at the JW Marriott South Beach for a recent 3 night stay and we enjoyed it immensely. The initial impression is of a typical business hotel. The lobby area and reception are so so - kind of long and narrow with not that many seating areas if you have a larger group or waiting for a room to be ready. We were upgraded to a Premium King room and I would say the room also is nothing special. In fact I would say the rooms are pretty small for an upscale 5 star hotel. The bathroom is spacious with separate toilet (heated seat, which I don't care for really) and separate shower. The amenities are top notch. They give you a hot kettle in the room to heat up water if you want coffee - instant NesCafe coffee - which is less than desirable I'd say.

JW Marriott Hotel Singapore South Beach,Avoid this property of Marriott,We stayed at this property during our transit halt. We had booked 2 suites. When we reached there they didn’t had suites close enough and we didn’t want my kids and my 82 Year old mom to stay away from us. So we settled for smaller rooms next to each other. Once we reached back to San Francisco the hotel emailed us that shower bottles were missing and charged us $200.00 In fact there were no shower bottles but three Velcro stripes. We took shower with a soap bar. I have been a Marriott member from past 5 years and never heard a thing like that. I replied to their email but no reply.

JW Marriott Hotel Singapore South Beach,Best place to stay in Singapore if you are a frequent Marriott traveler,"I switched to the JW Marriott in Singapore in April from two other Marriott hotels I had stayed at for the 5 prior years. The team and the hotel are the best. Hazel, Gabriel, Renz, Cora and QiYi in the lounge are absolutely the best. Zita, responsible for frequent guest relations is lovely and Fifi, Kay, Elyssa and others in the lounge are also great. As is Saatiis from the bell desk. I have said for years that the JW Marriott Hong Kong is the best hotel for high level Bonvoy members in Asia, but the last year has convinced me that the JW Marriott South Beach in Singapore (followed closely by the St Regis Singapore) is the best Marriott hotel in Asia.

JW Marriott Hotel Singapore South Beach,Amazing stay with the BEST club lounge,"Where to begin… our stay was absolutely amazing. From the beautiful rooms, the generous offering, wonderful housekeeping service (everything was replaced daily and never a missing item) to the best club lounge I’ve ever experienced (and I’ve been to a lot!). The club lounge was the standout though I must say. The whole team that served us during our stay were friendly, fun, efficient and nothing was too much to ask. They topped up drinks generously and made the effort to always say hi and chat. It was so genuinely warm and just lovely.

JW Marriott Hotel Singapore South Beach,Traumatic experience and did not live to the JW standard,"The experience didn’t live up to the JW Marriott brand. I was very disappointed and will not return. 1. The check in line was about 20 people line. Very inefficient process (about 5-7 minutes per customer check in. I counted). 2. I got a room in the east building which must be the worst layout. It had no view (looking out into wooden panels which then look into a restaurant arcade. It was loud and dark. At night 10pm can still hear speaker music from the restaurants) 3. The room was tiny. My room had no bath tub. The room lacks the basic amenities, for example coffee machine. For a hotel that’s charging 600+ per night, it should not serve Nestle instant coffee packets. 4. The AC thermostat wasn’t working. It was too cold and did not respond to control. 5.

The executive lounge good - less selection which is expected, but poorer service which is unexpected There are restaurants within the premises but not part of the hotel - akira back, madam fan etc. I suggest you venture out to get better food and value Didn’t have time to use the",5 out of 5,May 2023,5.0 of 5 stars,#25 of 372 hotels in Singapore,0.28122222222222226,0.4714444444444445,64.06111111111112,47.14444444444445,28.122222222222227,Location

Because I’m Japanese so my English is not that well, but he kindly spoke slowly and chose easy words to get me understood easily. The most thing I was surprised is every time I went to the fitness room, he always said hello and called my name. He’d meet lots of people using the fitness room, but he kept remembering my name, which was impressed. I’ve never experienced such kind hospitality.

It appeared to stop at midnight but we had early mornings and had to sleep early - we couldn’t even escape it by turning over because the facing walls in the room were all mirrored.

JW Marriott Hotel Singapore South Beach,Good option for business in a nice area,"First time at this property and booked it as it’s pretty convenient to the airport and business meetings. Very helpful bellmen and bags were brought up as soon as I got to my room. We are lifetime titanium with ambassador status so have a nice room with a lovely view. I liked the light blocking blinds and shades that were important to me after a very long flight and working odd hours. I think the areas for improvement are (and, maybe it’s just the room we had), but there is absolutely NO space to set anything in the bathroom. The sink takes up the entire space and there’s barely a ledge for a toothbrush. I had to leave all my products in the bedroom and take them in as I needed them. It’s kind of bizarre because the bathroom is nice size.

They were extremely friendly and excellent with the service when I ordered. Allowing my stay to feel like a home away from home. Not only that Fizah from At Your Service took my order with patience despite many questions and requests for my order and explained it to be slow which i really appreciated. Luka from housekeeping was also very helpful and cheerful when sending me my room request he even went out of his way to help me move some furnitures around when i needed to place my things and didnt have space. Overall the service at this hotel has been splendid in general and I would love to return again soon.,5 out of 5,August 2023,5.0 of 5 stars,#25 of 372 hotels in Singapore,0.28802083333333334,0.5708333333333333,64.40104166666667,57.08333333333333,28.802083333333332,Services

JW Marriott Hotel Singapore South Beach,Average at best,"The hotel looks beautiful from the outside and common areas are very nice. However, the rooms are quite dated and not up to par for what this hotel portrays itself as. Staff is very professional however lacks any sense of kindness, empathy or just plain being nice. As a Marriott Titanium level do not expect any recognition of status or appreciation. The club experience is also something quite overrated. The club space is very small which leads the staff to do stupid things like not allowing your children traveling with you in… penny wise - dollar foolish mindset. Overall quite disappointed based on other reviews leading us to choose this establishment.",3 out of 5,August 2023,5.0 of 5 stars,#25 of 372 hotels in Singapore,0.04197802197802199,0.5832417582417583,52.098901098901095,58.324175824175825,4.197802197802199,General

JW Marriott Hotel Singapore South Beach,Variable,"Generally, a variable stay: I booked a suite room and was pleasantly surprised with an extremely early check-in, which I greatly appreciate.  However, there were cleanliness issues: food scraps and flies in the room, and even one which was dead/asleep on the bedsheets. There was also an unidentified blackish-looking item Had to endure the cleaners cleaning the room while I was inside. While this was happening, the cleaners, Angela, and xu qi, noticed that I finished the coffee , so they gave me more.  Regarding hardware, there were cracks/patches in parts of the room, and stains on the bathtub that couldn't be removed , so the room is definitely showing signs of age.
