Village Hotel Albert Court by Far East Hospitality,"Convenience, Value, all we need","This is a great value hotel for a trip in Singapore. Extremely well situated with easy access to main stations and bus. It is lined with lots of convenient meal options. Breakfast is okay but it's limited for our taste. Not a big deal as there are so many food options everywhere in Singapore. The hotel staffs are all warm and friendly, very helpful and gave us guidance and suggestions on where to go in Singapore. We stayed until they closed so it is such a pity.

Village Hotel Albert Court by Far East Hospitality,Comfortable stay at walking distance from Little India,"Visited with family- 2 seniors, couple with a kid The hotel is centrally located well connected. At walking distance from Rochor MRT station and Little India Station. Bugis is also not very far. The staff is very friendly and helpful. We forgot to take printouts of our tickets and they happily printed it for us. Rooms are averaged sized, modern and comfortable. Some of the rooms have nice view of the Bukit Timah road. free wifi is available in the room. Prices are reasonable, we paid about S$157 per night per room.

This was unfortunately not possible. We offered to pay extra and the staff kindly then offered a room on ground floor. When we entered the room We got the baby cot as asked. As I was about to lay our baby I noticed pubic hair in her cot! Outraged I went through the rest of the room. The bathroom was not clean and there was hair on the floor (clearly not cleaned) and the bathtub (I took a look) there was an insect and hair too. I directly went to front desk to complain. The staff quickly cleaned the room and we got our rest. Unfortunately their mistake stayed in my mind rest of the week. When our family room was ready we moved in there.

We stayed at Village Albert Court for four nights; guess a reasonable duration to judge any hotel.

It has got that old charm which gives it a character which we found it pleasing (honestly, first look and impression was not what we expected, but it gradually grew on us and we started liking it). Location wise, it is roughly 20 kms from Changi airport and takes around 30 to 40 minutes to reach the hotel. Those from India, proximity to Little India is usually considered to be an advantage.

Village Hotel Albert Court by Far East Hospitality,Spacious and comfortable stay,"I've stayed in two Far East's hotels in different locations and both are great yet offered very different experience. This time I decided to try Village Hotel Albert Court due to its strategic location. It's located in between two MRT stations (Little India and Rochor) within short walking distance, and just a few stations away from Marina Bay. My check-in process was a pleasant and surprise one as initially I booked a small room with discounted price but got upgraded to a Club room, probably because I traveled with my pregnant wife and a 1year old toddler. The room was very spacious with a super king size bed and that's really comfortable for a family to stay in.

Village Hotel Albert Court by Far East Hospitality,Good Use Of A Traditional Building,Singapore has a record of demolishing old buildings and replacing them with boring new buildings so it is good to see a heritage building being put to good use. It would seem to be quite a while since the conversion took place and new modernisation is needed. We stayed in the club wing. The bathroom is adequate but dated and most annoyingly we couldn’t find any light switches. This meant removing the key card from the master switch when we needed to sleep.

We had booked a room for four (myself and our two sons.. 11 & 10) yet they were only giving us 3 beds in our room... no sofa bed just a queen and a single. After I repeatedly asked where my second child would sleep they reluctantly wheeled in another single bed. The room was grotty and dated and stank like someone had spilled bleach on the floor. The lights by the bed were bent and nearly electrocuted my husband when we went to find the switch to turn it off... instead he blew a fuse. No apology when we informed reception. To turn out the lights you have to take the card out of the wall ... leaving no active light switch in the bathroom (or anywhere) if you need to use it during the night. Not ideal with children.

They brought in the extra bed, as requested for 1 room. The other room was not ready at that time, but was available in the next 10 minutes. Went into the second room and were suprised to see a queen bed in there. It was way too small for us to accomodate. Went in back on the reception and requested Jana.

Very near to Little India underground station which can be used to get around the city easily. The hotel, in places, is tired and, in the rooms we stayed in, could do with a refurbishment. Nothing major but plaster/paint peeling off the walls, stains in bathroom etc. We had to move rooms during our stay due to our room being adjacent to a very busy road. The windows were single glazed and so we struggled to get to sleep. Top tip - if you’re visiting this hotel ask for a room over the courtyard and on a higher floor, we found this much quieter. Breakfast was ok, not a great selection but it did have a fresh egg station which we used daily for omelettes and fried eggs.

Village Hotel Albert Court by Far East Hospitality,Disappointing,"I love Village hotels, each of them has its charm. However, this particular property requires an immediate upgrade and also a different approach from the management. 1) They do renovations while having staying in house. Good properties close a wing for refurbishment then open once all works completed. In Village hotel guests see empty fountains, lifts under renovation and it’s constant. 2) The 2nd wing rooms are disaster. My washbasin was clogged so I had to decide not to shave, it was filling up to the top very fast. There was also water on a floor coming from somewhere (I didn’t use shower all day and there was water). The building has aircon machines on its roof creating noise and vibration in upstairs rooms.

The bathroom does not have a bidet, so I suspect someone who doesn't use toilet paper tried to somehow use the sink. Went immediately to front desk at around 12:30 am, and the reception (an elderly Malay man) was grossed out with the picture I took and immediately changed my room, and upgraded, to Premier room (room 106).

Village Hotel Albert Court by Far East Hospitality,Disappointed stay,"Came here 'cos of good reviews but now i really wonder how the good reviews came from. Front desk service charged me for the room upon check in although i repeated shared my app screen that my booking had staff paid when i booked online. Staff then brushed me off saying i can go to my room and can come down again if there's any issues. I had to login to my bank account to proof that i have made payment before staff reverse the additional payment. Bathroom had ramnants of used materials from previous guest. Bathroom door is not working well. Sink drainage is slow. Room is not soundproof. I can hear everything from conversations next room, bar music downstairs, knocking, flushing and was aruptly awoken from sleep cos of door slaming.

Village Hotel Albert Court by Far East Hospitality,Terrible customer service the minute I arrived at the hotel,"After checking in the guy at reception Pointed me towards the escalator and me to carry my luggage on it in order to get to the lifts. Even though in most places it's prohibited to carry luggages and prams on the escalator. However this guy never told me that there was lift on the other side, until next morning I find out myself. Oh also no one even bothered to show me my room. Mind you I checked in at 01:30am. On top of that first 3 nights I had to deal with smell of the mould in my room, crying and screaming kinda along with their parents and pound noise of traffic and construction. I barely slept!! After complaining it twice one of the manager was nice enough to change my room to upper floor with less disturbance.

For an older female traveller the atmosphere feels safe and cosy and best of all quiet. The staff are very efficient, friendly and helpful.
