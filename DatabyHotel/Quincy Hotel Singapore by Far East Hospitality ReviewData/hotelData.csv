Quincy Hotel Singapore by Far East Hospitality,Quite expensive! More than we were notified,"Staff at hotel were very good and service was great. Room was lovely but not the best we have stayed in. Swimming pool was really small. Found it very expensive when charged. Originally when we booked we knew it would be dear but ended up being a lot more than we thought. In August we received a notification that we would pay $718 NZ ( for everything, 2 nights) before we stayed. I have a photo of this but it will not let me upload it to this site. This was not charged at the time as stated ( we were travelling in Europe and found out later ) when payment was processed after we left Singapore it was $770.25! Understand about exchange rates etc but this seems excessive given that it was not over a long time.

The staff are excellent and hospitality is super. It’s the little things and for me it was when I was a little ill and got laryngitis. It was 3am and I needed to find a pharmacy which they helped with and when I came back the receptionist (can’t recall her name unfortunately) had a cup of honey and lemon waiting for me.

Quincy Hotel Singapore by Far East Hospitality,A real treasure,"Having stayed in Raffles City the past few times I was in Singapore, I thought to try somewhere near Orchard Road this time. The Quincy Hotel is in a good location just off the main street and so is quieter. Everything is well thought out at the hotel and the service is simply superb. I travelled on business this time and my colleagues (from the UK) also thought highly of the hotel. In future I would return with friends and family but perhaps not with very young children as this is more of a business-type hotel, for example the swimming pool is better for doing laps than for playing around. The breakfast and dinner are generous and also, there are drinks between 12pm and 6pm.

I did not hear any noise. The room was stocked each day with complimentary coke and other drinks. And three small bags of chips and snacks. They serve snacks during the day in the restaurant.

Quincy Hotel Singapore by Far East Hospitality,Birthday staycation,"Was here for a birthday staycation but we felt quite disappointed with the birthday decoration package which additional amount has been topped up for the decor.

There was a slice of cake provided during the evening cocktail and polaroid photo for us to keep. Our initial room assigned was not cold and not sure if it was due to the very warm weather outside or air con wasn't working well.

Quincy Hotel Singapore by Far East Hospitality,Great stay,"I stayed for just over a week in March 2022. Great friendly staff. Special mention goes to Olivia for her great Korean restaurant recommendations. Location of the hotel is good if you prefer something a little removed from the main action on Orchard Road.

Quincy Hotel Singapore by Far East Hospitality,A lovely short stay!,"I had a great time at Quincy. Location was good! Near to paragon, far east plaza n lucky plaza. They had 24hours free light refreshments/snacks as well as free wine n canapés from 6-8pm. Some minor issues we faced was staff forgetting to seve water, no granola which was included in the breakfast set... I had to remind staff and she didn't apologize and asked how many I wanted! Such a silly question as it's supposed to be served to each person. No coasters for drinks on one occasion. Swimming pool is covered and has 24hr access but you have to go down to the lobby to access the pool as staff have to press the lift button for you. Abit troublesome.

Hotel attendants were attentive and ready to cater to any requests. 10/10 for service , 6/10 for amenities (pool seems well kept but hotel generally looks like it’s in need of abit more love) , room was well kept too, just abit dusty and had a weird smell (like a scent but I guess that might be the air freshener or smth).

Quincy Hotel Singapore by Far East Hospitality,Great choice for those on a budget in Singapore,"We picked this hotel as it was within budget and in the right location, and we were very happy with our choice. The front desk staff could not be any more helpful or friendly--from check-in to ensuring we got a taxi, etc. My colleague and I reserved Premier rooms and availed of the additional amenities, which were a nice touch. Rooms were very clean, spacious and bright and included a good sized bathroom with a separate shower and bath. The gym was good and no one in it, as was the pool. Great to have and a beautiful view. We were checking out late so we had the use of the showers and changing rooms at the gym which was another plus. If I were to be picky, I would say that breakfast could be improved.

The room was spacious and it was the first room with a bath in a month of travelling. Lovely shower and a bidet toilet, (which was an experience). Check-out is 12:00, but my plane left after 23:00. They were happy to hold my bags securely for me, but as the weather was really wet and thundery, the staff said I could hang around in the public areas sorting my photos and writing reviews for my long trip. They even said I could use the pool and other facilities and have a shower before I travelled. That kindness alone made the experience really good.

The water is also EXTREMELY cold, and it's so ridiculous because this was supposed to be one of the highlights of our hotel stay. After a 10 minute swim, we couldn't endure the cold anymore and had to retreat to the warmth of our hotel room.

From the moment we checked-in till the moment we checked-out the staff went out of their way to make our stay enjoyable.

The inclusions were brilliant, complimentary food and drink, a complimentary minibar and complimentary use of a Handy Phone. A special mention must go to Kit Yin, who kept the drinks flowing during the 6 pm to 8:30 pm happy hours.

Really nice place small but quiet pool and excellent extras including free food, drinks and minibar. Sauna and steam room a disappointment, but pool great fun and gym looked really well equipped. Couple of suggestions for management: disappointed that laundry was not clear at 2 items per room rather than per person. Could make that clearer on the terms/at check in. And whilst we filled in food preferences we did not feel we are directly catered for with a vegan diet. There were things to eat at breakfast and evening snacks (soya milk provided when we asked) but we were not given much choice or offered vegan options.

Quincy Hotel Singapore by Far East Hospitality,Room Maintenance & Food and Beverage Questionable,"Stayed at the hotel with a family member and was able to see that the issues I had in my room were also in their room, the rooms are in a definite need of updating and maintenance needs to take a room offline to ensure that they can completely re-paint the rooms and perform a proper siliconing in the bathroom (it looked like a five year old had undertaken this task). Housekeeping also need to pay attention to the signs about hanging up your towels to re-use, I did this and on every occasion they were replaced with new towels which was not very environmentally friendly. The corridors also appeared to be something out of a horror movie, lighting was definitely inadequate and more lights need to be placed in them.

Quincy Hotel Singapore by Far East Hospitality,The Quincy-Outstanding!,"A group of five adults our stay at the Quincy was fabulous. Located just a 5 minute stroll to Orchard Road and a 10 minutes from the train. The staff greeted us warmly every time they saw us. Buffet breakfast was included each morning and consisted of fruits, juice, yoghurt, toast, bread rolls, cheeses and cold cuts of meet as well as the usual bacon, eggs and other hot dishes. The coffee was great (a must for me) and available from 6:45 am. During the day snacks were available for the guests (no extra charge) with lovely cakes, biscuits and endless soft serve ice cream for the sweet tooth. Happy hour was pretty special as well, after 6pm. Once booked in you were able to have two items laundered each day (excluding days of arrival and departure).

The staff were all lovely and very helpful. We booked a package deal which had breakfast, light daytime refreshments and light dinner included plus complimentary minbar and two items of laundry included each day. It was excellent and we rarely ate elsewhere unless we wanted to. The size of the rooms for the price also really impressed us compared to what we’ve previously experienced.

I arrived at about 930 am to drop my bags off but was greeted by a friendly team who said my room was ready! Rooms were nice and large and the free in room bar and snacks was a nice touch. I didn’t realize the snacks were also free so after I’d eaten a bag of crisps that evening had expected to be paying but again was nicely surprised. :-) especially nice when you come in late from work drinks and have the munchies. Breakfast was your bulk standard hotel fare but when breakfast, lunch and dinner are ALL included you can’t expect too much. Bottom line it’s a great value hotel.

Quincy Hotel Singapore by Far East Hospitality,Funky hotel right next to Orchard Road.,"A well travelled friend of mine recommended the Quincy. We arrived early evening after a seriously delayed Qantas flight from Melbourne. The team at the front desk were disarmingly friendly, I mean really friendly. The check in process was smooth and in moments we were headed up in the elevator to our room. The building is quite old, but has had a makeover and when we arrived in our room we were most pleased. Lots of attention to detail, comfortable with all the trimmings. There is a complimentary happy hour downstairs in their groovy bar. My wife had a fairly crappy Long Island Tea, cordial not fresh lime... I had a red wine that was OK. The food on offer was not exactly haute cuisine, but hell, what do you get for nothing.

Quincy Hotel Singapore by Far East Hospitality,A Great Find,"Just spent 6 nights at the Quincy Hotel and it was top notch. The location is very central, just a 5-10 minute walk from Orchard rd makes it the perfect place from which to explore the city. While it had everything a four star hotel could offer, the Quincy went a step further by offering lunch, cocktails as well as dinner to all their guests. For me the best part was their coffee machine (not a Nescafe fan) which helped me get started in the morning as well as the evening.

Quincy Hotel Singapore by Far East Hospitality,Excellent staff in a centrally located Hotel,"We loved this hotel. Nothing was too much trouble for any of the staff receptionists, and waiting staff. I particularly liked Sally she was full of local knowledge and very helpful, there was another lady who I didn’t catch her name who went above and beyond as well. All of receptionists were very helpful and nothing was any trouble. For example, on the last day we kept our room on until 6pm as we were flying at 23-15. They looked after our baggage whilst we nipped down to orchards shopping centre to get a couple of last minute bits, when we returned a bit hot they offered us soft drinks and snacks to keep us going. I was so grateful. We stayed 4 nights then went to Malaysia for three nights then returned for three.

Quincy Hotel Singapore by Far East Hospitality,Great boutique hotel,"We arrived at the hotel around 4pm but our room wasn't ready yet. When I booked, it stated that check-in was at 3pm so I was rather disappointed with that. We were told to wait for an hour so the maid can finish cleaning our room... We complained and the manager came back 5 mins later and said our room was ready. The location was decent, but we thought it was a little too far from Orchard Road. It is a good 10 mins walk from Orchard Road. The amenities, complimentary mini fridge, and light refreshments were the highlight of the stay. Every morning there is breakfast buffet and the light dinner every night was very tasty! The staff at the hotel are very polite and nice. The only thing that can improve is the speed of cleaning the rooms.

They welcome you back each day as a friend, or at least with recognition. We contrasted that with our wander through Marina Bay Sands, which was so huge that you must be just another statistic. The worst was seeing people queueing to check in, herded by those zig zag webbing lines. Quincy was considerably more personal.

Quincy Hotel Singapore by Far East Hospitality,Great Anniversary Staycation,"We stayed in Quincy hotel for our Anniversary. The room is beautiful with a window corner area with cushions for sitting and enjoying the view. We opted for the upgrade with a u-shape bolster on the bed and whiteboard wall with markers to play with. The toilet is also very spacious with a separated bathtub and shower area. However, the door is a sliding door which means that the closet will be open when you wish to close the toilet door. The room also has many free goodies in the mini fridge and cupboard. There is also free breakfast, high tea and evening dinner provided by the hotel. Do take note that sandwich is also served from 12pm to 2pm and cakes are served from 2pm to 6pm.

Quincy Hotel Singapore by Far East Hospitality,Good location and brilliant concept...,"We had a two night stay in the Quincy last week, whilst returning from NZ to the UK - and we really enjoyed ourselves. All the staff are welcoming and enthusiastic - they actually want to help and are proud of their hotel. Our room was on the 5th floor with good views over the surrounding area, and all the facilities you could want or need. The 'all inclusive' concept (which is explained at check in) is great and works well - breakfast, laundry, wifi, day time snacks and an evening buffet with drinks are all included. We haven't come across this idea with hotels of this standing before and wonder why others don't emulate it?

Quincy Hotel Singapore by Far East Hospitality,Hype-less,"Unclear on all the buzz. I stayed here based on Telegraph rec ... Telegraph usually never lets me down but first times and all that. With clever marketing this hotel comes across as very chic boutique, but felt much more like a dressed up Ibis. The rooms were hot and very institutional looking, especially the flooring - felt like I was at school. Bathrooms are average. Beds average. Most disappointing - the food. Evidently it appeals to the masses based on this hotel’s popularity but reminds me of Hilton executive floor (you pay for an “upgrade” but the wine’s cheap and the food previously frozen.)

The all inclusiveness was great and a good drawcard to stay here. Food and drinks during ""light"" refreshments was very generous.

Amenities were great and having a mobile phone to use was extremely handy and saved having to get a Singapore SIM from one of the service providers. The hotel looks funky and interesting, which helps to keep it fresh and modern. Staff were delightful and helpful with any request.

Quincy Hotel Singapore by Far East Hospitality,Perfect Stay in Singapore,I would like to thank all the staff of the Quincy Hotel for making our stay extremely pleasant. Everyone was very polite and helpful with our requests. The house-keeping kept our rooms clean and comfortable and even on the day I accidentally left the Do Not Disturb sign on they came back in the evening to clean our room. The bathroom amenities were very good and the shower temperature and water pressure was perfect. The check-in & check-out process was quick. The free handy phone in the room was of a major help to us on our entire trip. The breakfast was delicious and so were the afternoon refreshments and evening cocktails and dinner. The taste and quality of the meals were so good we didn't feel the need to eat out of the hotel. Free minibar was also a bonus.

Some information is vague or confusing (for example, they say to give in the laundry by 10:30am to receive it back the same day, but doesn't mention where/who to give it to, - or when we asked for a taxi and shared with them our plans for the evening, they didn't mention that half the city is closed down because of national day celebrations and we won't be able to get where we want to go, so we got stuck in traffic and wasted a whole evening).",4 out of 5,July 2019,4.0 of 5 stars,#22 of 373 hotels in Singapore,0.016820987654320982,0.41697530864197535,50.84104938271605,41.69753086419753,1.6820987654320982,Value

Quincy Hotel Singapore by Far East Hospitality,Clean and compact,"I liked this hotel and booked it on the merit of the reviews. However as we were spending most of our short holiday seeing the sights I realise an all inclusive hotel was not suited to our needs as we were unable to take advantage of the benefits we'd paid for, so we probably spent more than we needed to for our accommodation in singapore. That being said the positives include the very friendly staff, the very compact but lovely and clean pool (with gorgeous view), small gym and restaurant. I didnt enjoy the breakfast at all unfortunately, so we went out for breakfast instead the second day. I thought there would be a lot more choice and the tables are quite cramped in the small restaurant area.

Quincy Hotel Singapore by Far East Hospitality,Ice Cream Lover's Dream,"Stayed at The Quincy for 5 nights late August and could not have chosen a better hotel. From the moment we walked in all of the staff consistently went the extra yard. Particular thanks to Tonny and Madeline on Reception and Kit & Ravi in the restaurant/bar. Also thanks to the breakfast chef. The best scrambled eggs we have ever had in a hotel. The system used of constantly replenishing small servings to the serving dish meant the various offerings were not stewed and sitting for a long time. The overall included offerings of breakfast, light refreshments and evening light meals and drinks was excellent, AND, the piece de resistance was access to a self serve soft serve ice cream machine throughout the day and well into the evening, with chocolate and strawberry sauce.

Quincy Hotel Singapore by Far East Hospitality,Very nice stay,"Stayed here as a solo traveller. Nice sized room compared to some other Singapore hotels. Huge bed, clean room with strong shower. Having food at the hotel was great and the cake and ice cream available throughout the day was a nice bonus! Pool and gym are open 24/7 and were almost always empty, so this is great for a solo traveller like me who wants to relax without noisy children running around everywhere. Hotel location is great with walking access to Newton Hawker and Orchard area. There are several MRT stations within walking distance so it is also easy to get around.

First and foremost the service provided by the staff was outstanding, and consistently at a high standard. The staff was always ready to assist and go the extra mile above and beyond regular hotel services. As as example for one of the many items they assisted me with due to my unfamiliarity with using the coach system in Singapore, the staff took time out of their busy schedule to recommend multiple options for booking, walk me through the process and making the booking on my behalf. In addition to the great service, the complementary meals, cleanliness of the rooms, central location and overall hotel quality were also of a high standard.

This hotel is in a great location, just off Orchard road but nestled in a quiet tree lined street. Easy walking distance to anywhere or a very quick Grab ride.
