Marina Bay Sands,Short visit,We stayed there for 1 night only to attend an event so we didn't had much time to explore the whole hotel. Great location with superb facilities. You will be amazed how many guests this hotel can accommodate everyday. They have 2 front desk counters in each side of the wing. Accessible to their MTR also there's mall next to it with a lot of restaurant choices. We get to visit their casino as well. A must visit in Singapore so I suggest you should make it worth it.

Marina Bay Sands,Stay at The Fairmont.,"Visited Singapore twice at Marina Bay Sands. With butler service. As a single woman. Horrible. You book a table at Spago and get seated at the bar with a Vogue magazine. After several phone calls. Butler service is ridiculous. The lounge is fantastic, great staff and food! I am sorry.

Marina Bay Sands,Amazing pool!,We stayed here for the access to the rooftop pool. The hotel itself is massive and you could easily get lost but it was worth it for us to have access to the rooftop pool.

Upon reservation I was informed to check in at Tower 3 reception.

There are biscuits, pastries and candies.Wifi and a lot of beautiful orchids. Front desk staff were very cordial and helpful. We also receive stem of flowers from the staff.

Marina Bay Sands,"Excellent Stay, Worth the Upgrade","When staying at a hotel with such a reputation, its very easy to approach with a cynical perspective. However, if our stay at Marina Bay Sands showed anything, it's that sometimes you can judge a book by its cover. Upon our initial arrival in a taxi, our bags were taken off us by a member of staff, ready to be brought to our room once we had checked in. Queuing at check-in took roughly 15 minutes and even though we arrived ~3 hours before it would normally open, we were told we could head up to our Deluxe King Harbour View room. This also meant that we could access the Infinity Pool straightaway, in that blissful quieter period in between the majority of guests checking out and checking in.

The hotel foyer is a bit like an airport doesn’t feel like a hotel at all.

The view from roof top pool is fabulous albeit the day we stayed was a bit overcast, there’s waiter service by the pool drinks and food quite expensive but we did expect that as Singapore is expensive.

Marina Bay Sands,Fab Feb Visit,"I was there during mid Feb and was relieved about the efforts the hotel was taking to protect guests from the Coronavirus. They were taking temperatures of everyone coming in and out of the hotel. The hotel wasn't full which was also a relief, I stayed in one of the top floors and was delighted by the huge room, amenities and spectacular view. I thought staying there was worth the price tag, the pool is a must do. I also greatly appreciated how easy it was to walk to Gardens by the Bay which was a great way to spend a day. The view from the rooftop restaurant is amazing but candidly Ce la Vie disappointed in the food and drink category; simply not worth the outrageous price tag. The staff at the hotel is wonderful.

Marina Bay Sands,Iconic and living up to it.,"Obviously the most iconic hotel of Singapore. So we had to stay here :-) The first impression when you come in, for us, was that it's huge! The lobby is immense, large and high. The reception is a bit 'American' with lines waiting to check in, but they are quite efficient. And very commercial, so they sold us an upgrade, which we really loved in the end. The room was great. Spacious and super view of the Bay and Singapore skyline. The famous pool is lovely to be at. It's not really a pool, in the sense that it's only about 80cm deep, so forget about swimming, but it serves very well to cool down and make super pictures. There is a great choice of restaurants in the hotel and if that's not enough, it's connected to the Mall where there are dozens more.",5 out of 5,February 2020,5.0 of 5 stars,#64 of 373 hotels in Singapore,0.28405372405372403,0.574004884004884,64.2026862026862,57.400488400488406,28.405372405372404,Location
Marina Bay Sands,"Wow, what @ spectacle!","Taking an Asian tour, we visited Singapore- which was the place I really wanted to visit. Spending some days there we went to the top of the building during the day, the views are incredible. Well with 53+ floors it was bound to be! The shape of the building - 3 towers topped by a ship shaped top is incredible. It’s the place to be to view the firework display, held each evening! There is also a restaurant & swimming pool to facilitate the hotel rooms within the structure. We met up with friends who happened to be over there at the same time & had a great time in the nightclub, and had a ringside seat to watch the light show, drink some wine & dance too!

Marina Bay Sands,It was worth it!!,"It’s not a cheap hotel and I think for a lot of people, it’s a one off, but i’m now not sure I can stay anywhere else in Singapore! Our room looked out over the Gardens by Bay which was wonderful and of course the infinity pool was everything we hoped it would be. We didn’t realise how long the opening hours were ( 06:00-23:00 ) so we visited the pool 3 times on a one night stay just for the novelty of a 10pm and 7am swim! We dropped our bags off at the hotel around 10am and was pleasantly surprised to be checked in early, though with Corona Virus the hotel was significantly quieter than usual but still very much appreciated. The one sour point was we popped up to Lavo, the rooftop bar and restaurant, for a cocktail before heading out for dinner.

It was pure rude of them, and I was affected throughout my whole journey because of this punk, I do not know his name but I do know he's a muslim.

The rooms are clean and quite comfortable in 2010 style. TVs are from another age though. First of all, if you come by car, be aware that there is no direct access from the car park to the hotel. You will have to walk through the entire adjoining mall with your luggage. And the mall is huge. You can tell that your stay does not start off in the best possible way. The hotel also is awsomely big, Somehow, we have a bit of the impression of being in Las Vegas or even at the airport, especially at the time of check-in.

Marina Bay Sands,Enjoyable Trip but do pre-book everything due to Covid,"Tips on how to maximize your Staycation: 1) Book your pool access immediately after making your hotel booking. The max allowed capacity at the pool is 45pax from each Hotel Tower at any point of time. Each Hotel room is only allowed an 1 hour visit to the pool per day (for our 3D2N staycation, pool access was full & almost fully booked for the entire week of our stay) 2) Pre-order Peking duck at Blossom restaurant 3 days in advance (they are having promo of $48++ for entire Peking duck) 3) Coordinate your family's hotel facilities usage schedule: pool, gym, sauna, skylark all requires 1 key card per pax for entry. The hotel room only operates when the hotel-issued card is slot in. Therefore if 2 pax are at the pool, those in the hotel room will not have any electricity /",4 out of 5,October 2020,5.0 of 5 stars,#64 of 373 hotels in Singapore,0.05833333333333333,0.7999999999999999,52.916666666666664,80.0,5.833333333333333,Amenities
Marina Bay Sands,Staycation,"Celebrated our anniversary on October 18th. The views of the city at night from our room is spectacular and definitely worth the price. On sunday night, we waited for the light and water show at 9pm but sadly there wasn't any. Another downside about this place is the lack of halal restaurants. Even the cake that was given for our anniversary wasn't halal too, abit disappointed. There is only 1 halal place which is Beanstro, previously Coffee Bean and Tea leaf (google didn't update) located at Shoppes. So we had no choice but to walk quite a distance outside of Shoppes to get our food which was abit inconvenient.

Beside the clean rooms, friendly staff, great food, spacious rooms, great views, awesome infinity pool, we had a few frustrations upfront our stay. Due to all the government regulations here in Singapore, of course, MBS as well has to change a few things in the way to operate. One of them is the fact that each room can only enjoy the swimming pool for one hour a day. When we emailed the hotel 3 days upfront, asking to book swimming slots, they told us that all slots were already taken. We were really angry.

When I was checking in, the staff told me that there were two options either on Lvl 33 (Tower 2) or Lvl 41 (Tower 3) and both had the same views. Since they were the same view, I obviously chose the higher floor room. No doubt the view from the bedroom of the city was spectacular, esp at night. However, I was disappointed that bathroom had the frosted glass where the view to the gardens would be. If I had not been misled by the staff, I would have went with the Tower 2 option instead.

Marina Bay Sands,"Staycation - Deluxe & Suite - Good, could be better","Never really thought I'd do a staycation, but with Covid putting paid to all travel plans for the last so many months a weekend away at a hotel barely a few kilometres from home suddenly seemed to be not that bad of an idea. The good - The hotel does a really great job of prioritizing health and safety and it felt very safe. The infinity pool - was not my first time, so the charm had admittedly worn off but was an instant hit with the rest of the folks in my group.

When my family members reached and was registering the two front office agents mentioned that there is no such thing as leaving the room keys in the room. Wrong info throughout 2. Tried to book slots for the infinity pool but system was full of bugs and eventually could not secure any slots. Was told by the front office agent that when I was trying to book on Oct 15 the system just went live and it was the first implementation thus there were a lot of bugs.

Quality of food at the clubroom was slightly better than at Spago. But still great nonetheless, they only served TWG tea. Coffee at the club was also better. We managed to book an hour for the pool only. Views didn disappoint. Swimming at night with a great view was such a lovely experience!

Rooms were good. Food was good. We had stayed in this hotel in Feb 2019 but we still miss the infinity pool. The best part of the hotel was the infinity pool. The view was breath taking.

I feel awful for the staff because they are wonderful, but their product is worse than any hotel I’ve ever been in. 1) Initial booking- I spent over an hour waiting for their email that would allow me to book our pool stay and our check in time. I called after 20 min saying I had no email even though I had a booking confirmation number. They told me to wait. Called after an hour, they finally rebooked because there was “a problem” with their booking system. Great. 2) They gave us an upgrade at check in from a grand club to their orchid suite (single step upgrade), probably because they could see I had 4 calls to",1 out of 5,March 2021,5.0 of 5 stars,#64 of 373 hotels in Singapore,0.08896103896103896,0.5831168831168831,54.44805194805195,58.311688311688314,8.896103896103897,Services

Marina Bay Sands,Wish for more real quality to match the hype,"Marina Bay Sands is a landmark. And somehow, it kind of just stops there. The exterior is splendid, and upon stepping into the lobby, you are greeted by a sense of modern grandeur. From here on, the hotel experience would start to appear lacklustre as compared to its glamour. Before I go on, do understand that I have very high expectations of this establishment because of its reputation and, of course, price tag. Majority of staff are well-trained and polite most of the time, but none of them displayed the intuition or sincerity that is characteristic of exceptional hospitality. My husband and I, two sleep-deprived parents carrying our 5-month old, checked in at the counter.

We took full advantage of the drinks and Canapes package, I do think the restaurant need a lot more people serving though, only 2 people at the time. The pool area as expected was really nice I was not impressed with the check-in system, you're asked what time we want to arrive, we arrived, only for the lady to tell us we would have to wait 10 min ok no problem, then another gentleman said it would be 20-40min wait!!!  Thankfully it was more like a 7min wait. We really did enjoy our staycation, its just a shame it was cut short by the new regulations.

Firstly the room was very spacious - larger and looked much nicer than in pictures. And THE VIEW through floor to ceiling windows was absolutely spectacular! The service we experienced was stellar. As it was my birthday, they guided us to the lounge area to get checked in, and had a staff (Joanne if I'm not wrong) escort us to our room. She was great, and even helped us to book a sunset pool slot even though they were supposedly ""fully booked"" on the booking website. Champagne & cake were delivered to the room too.

Absolutely go for this suite if given the option. Since we spent a week, we saw stunning, dramatic weather, rapidly changing, and really beautiful sunrises and vistas across the strait and Singapore.

For a hotel that has hundreds of rooms, there are only 18 seats in tower 1. I kid you not. No other spaces are available, good luck if you are trying to multitask and rush out some last minute work because there is NO SINGLE AVAILABLE SPACE. You have to snatch one of the 18 seats if possible, from one of the hundreds of people standing around in the lobby. The weird acyclic light installation is super precious - you cannot rest your laptop on it, but children can crawl all over it. I didn’t know laptops are heavier than children.

Once you get to the top there are great views but like everything else in Singapore (apart from the trains) it is expensive to eat/drink there.

Cost per person is $22SGD/£13/16USD as of February 2020. The views of the city and shoreline are great, it overlooks the F1 circuit and I would consider it a must do on a visit.

I wanted to experience the infinity pool, enjoy a relaxing break, and enjoy a premium hotel looking across the little Red Dot. I wish I had booked elsewhere. Here is where it went so wrong.

That took time to reboot/rework. Meanwhile, the check in staff were waiting for us behind the bunker with no one to serve. Farcical. B) Room. Went to our room. Amazing view across to the city.

Marina Bay Sands,Most over rated 5 star hotel,"What is the hype besides the view and the infinity pool. This is my take on MBS, as I come from a 5 star hotel too. A 5 star hotel should upkeep its standards of luxury and flawless guest services. Check in was a breeze, aside from the long usual queue and waiting time, I got my keys within 30 mins. (Cons of checking in during school holidays). I am travelling with an infant, hence upon making my booking, I informed that I would require a baby cot. Upon check in, I called the operator and was told that the baby cots were out of stock. I purposely placed my request when I made my reservation so to avoid such circumstances of ‘out of stock’. I headed down to the reception to speak to the manager of which only the supervisor was available. I explained to her I need a baby",1 out of 5,December 2021,5.0 of 5 stars,#64 of 373 hotels in Singapore,0.1349206349206349,0.5484126984126984,56.74603174603175,54.841269841269835,13.492063492063492,Amenities
Marina Bay Sands,Excellence in Adversity. True Professionals & Real GEMs.,"Stayed 3D2N with the family as a birthday celebration for my wife & son. I must give credit when credit is due. Though there were minor hiccups and inter department communication issues on the first day, they were sorted out professionally and expeditiously by the following staff that I am going to mention below. To begin with, staff of Premium Services, Ms Joanne Gonzaga and Mr Jerry Wong. The view from our room is AWESOME. Thank you for ensuring that we were well taken care of, simple things like valet, refreshments, thoughtful treats for the wife and kids and dining-in options (because it was so nice, we did not feel the need to leave the hotel).

The room had a small balcony that is sufficient for us to stand and chill with the breeze. The bathroom came with a super spacious vanity room with a bath tub too!

The room we had at the Hyatt was double the size for less money and the service was equally as good.

Yes it can be busy but you can plan around it. The downside that you can't plan around, is the behaviour of other guests.

Breakfast- wait in a line for up to 10 mins to be seated each morning. Wait in another line for up to 10 mins at most food station. A very uneasy and stressful way to begin your day on a vacation. Staff- perhaps due to covid, bad management or lack of care the staff are generally quite rude. Particularly the staff at the pool area. It’s closer to an asylum rather than a pool.

We couldn’t get a drink and swim because there are only certain times for that. So had to plan accordingly. Whatever happened to pool side service? I literally only stayed for the pool.

The lower floor room had a really big balcony and a super close view of the light and music show in the gardens.

Marina Bay Sands,Best pool in the world!,"We stayed for 3 nights at the beginning of our honeymoon. The view from the room was amazing - and even more breathtaking from the infinity pool! I recommend that you book your restaurants well in advance of your vacation. Sadly most of the restaurants at the hotel were fully booked for the duration of our stay, which didn’t leave many options for us. Room service took a very long time, which is understandable given the size of the hotel. We appreciated the chocolates offered to us by the hotel, as a gift for our honeymoon. We were very impressed with the housekeeping staff who did an amazing job. The hotel is in walking distance of the Gardens on the Bay, which is a great activity for tourists.

Marina Bay Sands,A Singapore Classic,"The Marina Bay Sands is a great hotel but its beigeness is starting to look a little dated. The views are outstanding and the location is very impressive. Tonnes of overpriced designer stores, and a relatively close food court and other good eating options nearby, seemingly for the Mainland Chinese visitors, good access for MRT and Taxis are almost non stop. The rooms were large and very comfortable, we all loved the automatic curtains and the large bathrooms. The Gardens by the bay are a great experience with the shuttle if the idea of a walk in 28c doesn't appeal to you. The nearby Art and Science museum was an unexpectedly fun trip and worth the visit if you have kids or a curious nature.

Marina Bay Sands,Worth it? YES!!,"Great hotel and great experience. The staff are very friendly, the hotel and rooms are extremely clean and the views are panoramic. Overall, Marina Bay Sands is worth the price of staying there at least once. The infinity pool is almost always open (6am-11pm) and was not crowded at all. During our stay there, we went to the pool as many times as we could and easily found lounge chairs. My only complaint is that the pool is not heated so it can get cold especially in the mornings. The food at the restaurants and the food court was delicious. The hotel is walking distance from one of the hawker centers (Lau Pa Sat) passing the marina into downtown.

However, out of all the hotels I have stayed at, I would like to say a special Thank You to Marina Bay Sands. On our holiday (we went to a few places), my 10 year old son became ill and became dehydrated. By the time we reached Marina Bay Sands, it was becoming obvious that he was not well. I contacted the front desk and the staff organised an ambulance and a doctor to come to examine him. Marina Bay Sands security helped take my son in a wheelchair to the ambulance and assisted us with our passports and details we would need to take to the hospital. The staff at Marina Bay Sands simply went above and beyond.

Marina Bay Sands,Still in awe from the amazing experience (Thanks NICOLE!!),"Travelled to visit Marina Bay Sands from the United States on Dec 28th, 2022. On December 22nd, 2022, I contacted Marina Bay Sands hoping to plan surprise proposal to my girlfriend on the Sky Observatory deck. No other piece of modern architecture is more iconic than MBS in Southeast Asia and I had my eyes set. In just the few days before the Christmas holiday, Nicole was offered to connect with my 3rd party photographer and help coordinate the proposal as if I asked my best friend one favor in my lifetime. She is an amazing human and I can tell why MBS is lucky to have her be the face of their iconic brand. Nicole granted permission for my photographer to be at the Sky Observatory Deck for the special moment when I popped the question.

Marina Bay Sands,Nice view but lack service,The rooms is adequate with great view but the hotel food service is lacking. I stayed two nights at the hotel but had two terrible experiences at the top floor and Rise on the ground floor for breakfast. The service level is not really live up to a 5 stars hotel. They seems do not feel like to serve us. The Rise staff even came to tell us half way into our breakfast buffet that they will charge $20 for juices even though the BUFFET is included in the room. We ask for the manager for explanation but hear nothing. It was later on find out if you go ask for freshly squeezed juice then it will be charged. If you go for the juice at the buffet table then it is free. However the waitress made the mistake never came and apologize for the mistake.

Marina Bay Sands,Come for the pool but stay for the excellent service,"Marina Bay Sands is a hotel that needs no introduction. Many stay for the pool alone and frankly that is a perfect reason to stay here. People often ask if the pool is as nice as it looks...and yes, it is. It is indeed a reason enough to stay here. What really surprised me about MBS though is the service. For such an enormous Vegas sizes property the service is fantastic. Everyone I interacted with across the entire hotel was lovely and happy to assist. Guest services and housekeeping was also excellent. Is it normally my kind of hotel, no..it vaguely looks like a bit like an airport terminal, albeit a very high end one.

Marina Bay Sands,Iconic,"It was always an ambition to stay here and finally achieved it. A lovely hotel and just our style, modern & comfortable. The roof top pool is a must and it’s lovely to lay by the pool and take a dip and enjoy the view. The gym is small for the size of the hotel but it always had space when we visited. The buffet restaurant was good but nearly always busy.

We had no idea that the restaurants would be so busy and it would be so hard to book once we were here, so book ahead! We ate in both Lavo and Cest la vie and had good meals in both.. the prices are extortionate though for what you are eating. Cest la vie’s menu is pretty limited too. We had a drink afterward in their sky bar which was really nice with that great view. Breakfast the first day, what a queue! We had to wait half an hour.. one of their restaurants, Rise is being refurbished so one less restaurant for breakfast… (my advice come early) we skipped it the next day but had had it the last 2 days and the queues were better but we were earlier.

It has a shopping mall, casino, multiple international restaurants and is well connected to metro station. We enjoyed every bit our stay there with most cherished experience being swim in the infinity pool which provides a unique view of the Singapore skyline. It's highly recommended to reserve the table at the night clubs and restaurants in advance as it's difficult to get a seat on spot.

This was a good help as we have a baby with us. The staff were so good and friendly - door staff, Check In, Luggage and Concierge. I didn't find the staff at the Rise reception very friendly - they hardly even said Good morning. Hotel is close to the Airport and many attractions. Also close to Gardens By the Bay. The Breakfast was good at Rise, but average at Spago.

Marina Bay Sands,Bucket List,"The MBS was on our bucket list, so we took the plunge. Yeah the hotel is expensive but for us it was a once in a lifetime trip. Could have stayed at the fours seasons for less but it doesn't have a 57th flr infinity pool and the cool light show. Booked a garden room view and we really enjoyed. Nice balcony and a great view of the skypark, and as a bonus a great view of the light show in the park. The room was nice with a huge TV led (70""). Bed was comfy and a practical layout, but nothing special. Minibar (non-alcoholic) was also included in our rate and was refreshed daily. Also, bottled water was provided daily - we got at least 6 bottles a day, and you could ask for more if needed.

Marina Bay Sands,Marina Bay Sands Hotel experience,A person I know stayed here and thought it was great so I had to do the same. The design of the building is fascinating and a great landmark in Singapore for kms around. The top part which looks like a boat is the famous pool with a view to die for and a bar in the middle. I absolutely had to try it out but it was cold in the water and only 21o or so out. Freezing! Even though I paid about $AUD 800 per night the $52 breakfast was extra! So we went elsewhere for it. There is a pedestrian walkway to the MBS Shopping Centre which is handy although the food court is a good 15 min walk. On the ground floor there are shops and restaurants. Would stay here again but not good value for money where the brekky's concerned as I've paid a similar rate at other places and got brekky.,5 out of 5,March 2023,5.0 of 5 stars,#64 of 373 hotels in Singapore,0.2328125,0.615625,61.64062500000001,61.5625,23.28125,Amenities

The service was impeccable, service staff were always making their rounds making sure guests feel comfortable.

Marina Bay Sands,Expensive but good experience,"We stayed here for 3 nights and yes we did queue for check In and room wasn’t ready so we went off to explore. When we had our room it was on floor 31 with a good city view and spacious although stayed in better. It was a pain to go to the rooftop pool as you need to take one lift then change and get another but do get there eventually. Now the infinity pool is the Gem for this hotel as perched on the 57th floor and although busy we always managed to find a sun bed. The views from this area are great. We ate at the pool and it’s quite expensive but then what would you expect at one of the most iconic hotels on the planet.

Waiting more than an hour in line to see a check in agent, waited another 20 minutes for her to input guest information only to be told our rooms were no available and it would be another hour wait. Once we finally were allowed to go to our rooms, the disappointment continues. The rooms are outdated.

Credit the hotels’ ingenuity for hiring photographers to help solo travelers like me had some instagrammable photos (albeit at a price🤣) Room is faultless. Just a bit old school like those five star hotels in the 90s, which is strange considering it opened in the 2010s. Food is decent. Lots of choice, including some fine dining ones. Check in feels like at the airport. Again too many people. Staff tried to clear the queue ASAP but people kept coming. Must be stressful handling this all day. Breakfast is good. If you choose Rise restaurant at lobby, be sure to get there before 9 am.",4 out of 5,August 2023,5.0 of 5 stars,#64 of 373 hotels in Singapore,0.3784391534391534,0.6108906525573192,68.92195767195767,61.089065255731924,37.84391534391534,Services

Marina Bay Sands,"""MUST DO"" when you visit Singapore.","My Sister and me stayed on Mid August 2023 in the Marina Bay Sands, Singapore. We visited Singapore 20 years ago, and we wanted to see what changed. And it was changed. A LOT. And from the BEST to THE VERY BEST. It’s no wonder why the Marina Bay Sands became one of the symbols of Singapore. After being in The Shangri-La Singapore (to be next to Orchard Road) we headed to the south of the city, and stayed for two days in the Marina Bay Sands, AND ITS IN ANOTHER LEVEL. The hotel is spectacular, and from the moment that we arrived everything went smoothly, efficiently and with a smile. We got our room with the City View, and ITS BREATH TAKING. The room was pure luxury. Spacious and equipped with all the modern comforts you could wish for, with a HUGE Smart Samsung 4K TV screen,",5 out of 5,August 2023,5.0 of 5 stars,#64 of 373 hotels in Singapore,0.3935064935064936,0.4120779220779221,69.67532467532467,41.20779220779221,39.350649350649356,Location

Marina Bay Sands,A Dream Proposal Come True,"It can't be more true that the reputation of this hotel precedes it. Nice environment, quality rooms, and first class service by the highly professional staffs of this hotel. My girlfriend (now fiancè) loves the marina bay area, so I chose MBS hotel to spring a surprise proposal. The proposal involved a quite a number of people and required a few factors for it to be a success. Even up to proposal day, I still had a number of uncertainties, which could have led to a huge fiasco if not for a few notable hotel staffs who helped me along the way: Roshini, the front desk staff who is surprisingly still in training, shows passion, poise, skill, tactfullness and sensitivity beyond her years in the hotel industry.

Marina Bay Sands,The Marina Bay Sands Experience,"My stay at Marina Bay Sands in Singapore has been nothing short of spectacular. First off, the hospitality was off the charts. From the moment we touched down, we were welcomed by their airport ambassador who assisted us with our luggages to our pre-arranged limousine ride. We were then greeted by the hotel personnel who were already on standby at the hotel's porch waiting for our arrival and were escorted straight to our room to check-in. As for our room, it was pure luxury. Spacious and equipped with all the modern comforts you could wish for. The attention to detail in the room decor was impressive. We were given a Dyson hair dryer, Bvlgari soap, and shampoos, Bang and Olufsen speaker, and a leather safe with jewelry and a watch compartment.

Marina Bay Sands,Thank you for the unforgettable memories,"I stayed at Marina Bay Sands to propose to my girlfriend. I started communicating with the staff about 3 weeks prior to our stay regarding the room decorations and bouquet preparations, and their quick response time made the process very smooth. To be honest, I was a bit nervous about preparing for the proposal because I was going to propose overseas and my English skills were not very good, but their support was excellent and once I started contacting them, I was able to proceed with the preparations with confidence. Upon arrival at Marina Bay Sands, two staff members escorted us to our room. We were thrilled to find champagne and chocolates in our room. I think they took special care of us because we had told them of our plans to propose.

Marina Bay Sands,Amazing hotel but not sure I’d do it again,We stayed one night in the hotel. The good parts of it are the staff are fantastic. Friendly and very willing to assist. The room was clean and spacious with an amazing view of the city. And of course the rooftop pool is simply amazing. However the room was missing glasses and a few other items which was surprising. The bed was also very hard. Some people would like this but I prefer a softer bed. Overall it was a great stay however I don’t think I would do it again as I didn’t really think it was value for money.,4 out of 5,September 2023,5.0 of 5 stars,#64 of 373 hotels in Singapore,0.2775,0.5436111111111112,63.87500000000001,54.361111111111114,27.750000000000004,General
