Rendezvous Hotel Singapore by Far East Hospitality,Rendezvous Hotel,I just checked out yesterday morning after my usual 1 night layover in Singapore. This was I think my 4th visit to this particular hotel in Singapore. I would have rated this visit higher because this hotel has a great location and by far the best chicken strips buffalo style I have tried anywhere in the world. You have to get them from room service. They are that good and reasonably priced. The only small snags that brought the rating down were the fact that I was given the room furthest from the elevator. I couldn’t believe the hike. Then also when going for a shower before heading out for my nearly 24 hour flight I noticed that the faucet was leaking really bad leaving a big puddle on the bathroom floor.

Mainly large high rise hotels. Our most recent holiday to Singapore started on the 2nd of Oct 2019 and it started off with probably the best reception we’ve ever experienced. As we’d only booked a week before our stay the room that would be most suited to us ,an adjoining room, was not available. Andrew James checked us in and made it possible. He didn’t ask, he just knew. The result was an extremely comfortable and enjoyable stay. The location was excellent. More appropriate for our type of holiday than the other hotels I’ve stayed in. The opening of the new MRT station right outside was a godsend. The buffet every morning was as good as most. Omelettes were my favourite.

Rendezvous Hotel Singapore by Far East Hospitality,Comfortable stay at Singapore,Kind of a late review. I was there at Hotel Rendezvous on last December during the Christmas. I was on a official travel and I had second thoughts when I'm booking the hotel since it was my 1st time at Rendezvous hotel. However I must say I was wrong. The hotel is really good. They have a friendly staff. The only problem we had was me and my colleague couldn't get near by rooms. Rooms are spacious and comfortable. I had a problem in the shower but the a person from maintenance department helped mt out to fix that. Unfortunately I can't remember his name & appreciate if Hotel can find out the person and reward him by following the booking i made under my name. Hotel Rendezvous has a small bu good Buffet. Don't have a larger choice but it's really good. very close to MRT and bus,5 out of 5,December 2019,4.0 of 5 stars,#52 of 373 hotels in Singapore,0.13088235294117648,0.5450980392156863,56.544117647058826,54.50980392156863,13.088235294117649,General

However, it didn't show up eventually and I waited till night. I could've arranged one from another cake shop if I knew this wasn't gonna happen. That was a BIG let-down! 2.

Rendezvous Hotel Singapore by Far East Hospitality,Wonderful Staff and Great Location,"We chose this hotel as a place to recover from jet lag a couple of nights before our cruise.

Rendezvous Hotel Singapore by Far East Hospitality,Old hotel with small room but bed is comfortable,Stayed here for 3 days as the hotel is centrally located. Check in was smooth. The hotel reflects what you pay for. There are no bottle water provided in the room as the tap water is safe to drink in Singapore. This so an old hotel the carpets and furniture in the room reflects it. Room is small but the bed is comfortable and most importantly the room is clean. It is a no frills hotel so it is better to grab breakfast across the hotel in the food court. Overall this is a average hotel but it is value for money at over $250 Singapore a night without breakfast. Location is good. If your budget is around the Singapore $200 plus a night this will do.

I understand the rationale, but you should not have insulted your guest that way. Upon check-in, you should have alert me with the information to avoid feeling insulted.

So human nature dictates that you turn towards the exit closest to you (I don't really know if its a scientific fact, but lets go with that shall we) So I turned left, and well, the numbers on the doors just did not tally up.

Kiki on reception was extremely friendly and helpful.

Room was lovely and we upgraded to have a few more perks. Close by metro and everywhere was close by. Housekeeping daily went out of there way to clean room and all staff chatted to us. My only complaint was breakfast as the food was not what you would expect and only Luke warm. Pool area lovely and both times we went we had the pool to ourselves.

Rendezvous Hotel Singapore by Far East Hospitality,Spacious Room & Convenient Location,"Compared to the other hotels I've stayed in Singapore, this hotel has much more spacious rooms that didn't make me feel cramped, for the same amount of money. The bed was really comfortable, and the room had a smart TV (which you would think every hotel has, but no). The wifi speed was good and the desk was a good size to comfortably sit and work on my laptop (as opposed to the more compact versions in hotels with smaller rooms). But what I really loved about my stay was the location of the hotel. It's right by 2 train stations (Bencoolen and Bras Basah), there's a bus station right in front, and a never ending supply of taxis.

I think there is room for improvement here. Our room was a strange kind. A double room with 2 huge beds, and no room for our huge suitcases. We could clearly smell the cleaning chemicals, and it was way too wet outside to even try and open the window. The temperature was also too high to try that. Luckily it was only for a single night. But we had a booking on our return tour. A different room, but same problem. So my opinion is: that was standard. If you like that, you can go for it.

Rendezvous Hotel Singapore by Far East Hospitality,"Location, location, location!","When I was living in Singapore I used to live near the hotel so am very familiar with everything around the hotel. Great location, close to 2 MRT stations with multiple lines, big shopping mall (Plaza Singapura) just a block away, and tons of eatery options from food court to restaurants nearby, SUPER CONVENIENT! Room is clean and very spacious. Service from staff is excellent, and price is reasonable for what you get (I got a weekend deal so even better!) The only small issue with me is that the toiletries could do with some upgrade - a 4-star hotel like this still uses the cheap 2-in-1 conditioning shampoo? But overall, great value!

Right on the train line as well. Didn't eat in cafe as looked very ordinary and limited options. Found an OK cafe Kith just near hotel which was good for breaky and coffee. The rooms were OK - no fresh air or balcony so a little stifling. The pool was ordinary with hardly any seating or lylo's - it was really pathetic having to sit on the ground. There wasn't enough toilet paper and had to request more a few times. There was no directory/room service or information available about the hotel or Singapore.

Not the newest hotel in town but very comfortable and clean. Service from check-in, club room, restaurant and bell boy was warm and sincere. It is nice that we (locals) are treated the same though many westerners at this hotel. Paid a little more for Club benefits and it's worth it. Any time we needed a snack (eg, after a swim), we can just pop in. Cocktails are served in the evening, and that made the man very pleased. Breakfast came with the hotel rooms complimentary and it was very satisfying. Hubby loved the seafood porridge. On a Saturday, there's acrylic painting session at the lobby.

Rendezvous Hotel Singapore by Far East Hospitality,First time visit but will return,"Chose this hotel after researching many due to our usual hotel being closed for refit. Value for money, this beats all other hotels easily. Whilst this hotel is listed as 4 stars - it is a little long in the tooth but everything works, it is the staff that make this a good choice in Singapore. I always look for a club room when here, they are a little more expensive but they offer so much more value. They offer breakfast even if you book a room only and you use the club room throughout the day with soft drinks, coffee, fresh fruit etc. They also offer cocktails, alcoholic drinks and a good selection of snacks for a couple of hours every evening.
