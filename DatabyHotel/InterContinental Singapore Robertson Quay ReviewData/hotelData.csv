InterContinental Singapore Robertson Quay,A thoroughly charming boutique hotel made extra special by the impeccable and friendly service.,"We highly recommend the Intercontinental Robertson Quay for a business or leisure stay. The location on the banks of the Singapore River is surrounded by cafes, restaurants and bars, just a short walk to Havelock MRT. The rooms appear on the small-ish side but the great layout and floor to ceiling window overcome the initial impression. We felt we had plenty of space during our stay. The lap pool is a decent size and a quiet place to enjoy a refreshing dip. We used the gym often and it‚Äôs well-equipped with a range of machines and weights. What elevates this hotel though are the amazing staff and the Intercontinental should be very proud of their personnel. The porters, concierge, reception, cleaning, room and hospitality staff are extremely professional and helpful while",5 out of 5,June 2023,4.0 of 5 stars,#24 of 372 hotels in Singapore,0.3387878787878788,0.5536363636363636,66.93939393939394,55.36363636363636,33.87878787878788,Amenities

InterContinental Singapore Robertson Quay,Memorable stay - exceptional service and hospitality!!,"WHEN & WHAT: We stayed at the hotel for 8 nights during September in a King Junior Suite - not sure if we booked the room with a river and city view but we did have one which was great. LOCATION: The hotel is on the riverfront at Robertson, about a leisurely 10 minute walk to or from Havelock which is the nearest MRT station to the hotel. Otherwise you can take a very scenic 10-15 minute walk past a plethora of restaurants and cafes to Clarke Quay. THE ROOM: I won‚Äôt harp on about the room size as other reviews have made the point about this - but let me just say I‚Äôm glad we booked the King Junior Suite as I wouldn‚Äôt have wanted anything smaller for 8 nights. A shorter stay may be fine in a standard room but certainly not for more than a few nights. The room had a 2 seater",5 out of 5,September 2023,4.0 of 5 stars,#24 of 372 hotels in Singapore,0.12371031746031746,0.47794312169312164,56.18551587301588,47.794312169312164,12.371031746031747,Location
InterContinental Singapore Robertson Quay,Great hospitality service in club lounge,"My wife and I had stayed for 1 night in a river view room with club lounge access on 23 Sep 2023 for my birthday celebration. With the club lounge access, we got to enjoy the afternoon tea snacks and evening cocktail session in the club lounge at level 4. The lounge is not huge but cosy. The lounge supervisor Mr Thines was so kind and thoughtful in surprising me with a potted Triramisu cake for my birthday celebration (from their in-house restaurant Publico). He and his team (inhee, Oscar & John) had also provided an excellent hospitality service to me and my wife throughout our time in the lounge. They had given me a very memorable birthday. Thank you Mr Thines and your team! :-)",5 out of 5,September 2023,4.0 of 5 stars,#24 of 372 hotels in Singapore,0.5265625,0.7875,76.328125,78.75,52.65625000000001,Services
