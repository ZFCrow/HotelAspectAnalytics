Andaz Singapore,Modern decor with youthful and attentive staff in a vibrant part of Singapore,"It is always nice to break out and try something new - especially when it works out so nicely as the Andaz Singapore. From its modern decor and well appointed rooms to the staff and food quality in the outlets I found the experience very nice way to return to Singapore after 2 years. I was a bit uncertain at first about its location, but the vibrancy of Kampong Glam, Haji Lane and Bugis area were a wonderful change from the mercenary shopping scene of Orchard Road. Hotel staff were also commendable for being friendly and very service oriented - they all went out of their way to try and help me.

Andaz Singapore,"Gorgeous hotel, with romantic experience marred by 665 Degrees Farenheit","We stayed at Andaz for the Klook 36 hour package, which was perfect for us. We checked in on the morning of our wedding day at 9am, and stayed till 9pm the following night. The room was wonderful and we got the corner room at 3730, providing a wonderful view. The room was a great size, with separate walk-in wardrobe, a huge bathroom, and a seating area which we used for the bridal make-up. No complaints about the room, honestly! It was very spacious and comfortable. We were happy to have booked this stay for our special occasion.

Andaz Singapore,Always perfect despite Low staff count,"Got the presidential suite at a discount and it was the second time we stayed there. Service was average - but I think it seems that’s the Andaz biz model where they focus more on the rooms and run on a rather lean staff count (as opposed to say a Capella where you run into staff asking you if things are okay all the time).

Andaz Singapore,Great experienced,"I stayed at both Andaz and MBS on my vacation so my review is going to be something of a comparison. While while the latter had a more spacious room, the former felt more homely and convenient. Andaz has small touches that had a large impact, like detachable showerheads (which for some reason MBS did not…?), and the lift at Andaz goes straight to the MRT and a path to Bugis Junction (press B3 in the lift). It was cozier and had a lot more food options than say, the Shoppes.

You can do online check in the day before, and they will email you once the room is ready so you can arrive and check in earlier as long as you receive the Room Ready email. Hotel room is clean and room service is fast too. Love that you can arrange room service by scanning a QR code label on the hotel phone so you can text the robot chat Andy and order in-room dining/room service without calling them. Great for introverts or anyone that doesn’t like to call. Check out is easy too. Just have to drop the room key in at their express check out box.

The room I was assigned to was very comfortable and had all the amenities a guest needed.

The staff also provided our wine glasses, plates and utensils. The staff also heat up (microwave) our take away food. Breakfast at alley 25 was so good.

Andaz Singapore,Staycaytion Review,"Having patronized many hotels during the pandemic period, it is safe to say that Andaz has impressed me the most in terms of service and amenities. Planning for a birthday celebration, kudos to the team for accomodating to my many pre check-in requests. The thing that really impressed me at Andaz was the food. I daresay it is one of the best food a hotel has to offer, having a vast travelling experience. To top it off, Miss Audrey Silvaraj displayed excellent profesionnalism which made my afternoon tea very memorable. If I had to be extremely critical, the pillows were slightly uncomfortable but still manageable. Will definitely revisit and looking forward to my next stay at Andaz!",5 out of 5,September 2021,no hotel class found,#65 of 372 hotels in Singapore,0.44333333333333336,0.6733333333333333,72.16666666666667,67.33333333333333,44.333333333333336,Amenities
Andaz Singapore,Is this a 5-star hotel? Doubtful abt that!,"This is not bragging but travelling to other parts of the world have totally exposed my family & I to excellent hotel experiences. All these years, we have been pampered & thus, expected nothing less from a Singapore hotel. As our house is undergoing minor renovation works, we have selected Andaz due to its proximity to many halal eateries (my helper's dietary requirement). However, upon our check-in yesterday night, we were too dumbfounded by the state of the rooms. Is this the experience promised by a hotel that was stated as a 5 star on Hyatt website? This is as bad as the Hyatt Regency Casablanca (another nightmare). Rooms smell musty / horrible, not sure whether it comes from the carpet or something else. Quite surprised that the housekeeping team didn't notice it when",1 out of 5,September 2021,no hotel class found,#65 of 372 hotels in Singapore,-0.07638888888888888,0.5935185185185187,46.18055555555556,59.35185185185187,7.638888888888888,Value

Last week, after all the stress at work, my daughter wanted to break away and have a staycation for her birthday.

Andaz Singapore,The Andaz - Singapore was absolutely stunning and gorgeous.,"If you’re even remotely considering to book Andaz - Singapore, just do it. The Andaz - Singapore was absolutely stunning and gorgeous. This was also one of the top hotels I’ve ever stayed at, especially as far as the Andaz brand goes. The rooms, lobby, pool, community areas and staff were phenomenal. From start to finish, the staff was thorough, professional and more than accommodating at each interaction. The best way to describe it is that everyone exuded a sincere, genuine warmth well fitted for a luxurious hotel property without an ounce of uptightness. We felt right at home. As far as design goes, one can tell that were was an incredible amount of time and thought put into every single detail and decision. Everything was very thought out and I was a huge fan.

Andaz Singapore,Beautiful hotel with subpar service,"Stayed for 3 nights and loved the hotel and room. It was beautifully designed, eco friendly and it was a huge plus that the mini bar snacks were included. However the service was so poor it surprised me. We asked for an extra duvet at the front desk when we checked in … no duvet was delivered that night. The only people that said hi to us in the hallways were the housekeepers. The men at the front doors gathered around one door and not both so when we walked in no one spoke or opened the door. When we called and they brought a duvet with comforter they didn’t even put the duvet on the comforter. Maybe it’s because we had just traveled from Vietnam and Japan but the service was horrible and led me to believe the Andaz just isn’t for me despite the delicious breakfast,",3 out of 5,March 2023,no hotel class found,#65 of 372 hotels in Singapore,0.20249999999999999,0.78,60.12499999999999,78.0,20.25,Services

In front of 6 guests (including me) waiting for the elevator, a bellman pushed his empty luggage cart ahead of all of us to take the cab first. The hotel manager acknowledged this. Later on it took 10 minutes for a bellman at the ground level to even make eye contact, much less say hello or do anything useful.

Andaz Singapore,Falling short,"Hotel competition is high in Singapore. The Andaz is a modern hotel and we decided to splurge and take a larger corner room to enjoy the additional space and views. The rooms are nicely designed, clean and comfortable. Unfortunately the lounge in the room had spots where the material was worn and torn. The shower was over engineered and you either had scorching hot water or it was luke warm. The concierge is located on level 2 with the reservation desk on level 35. We found it a bit disjointed, chaotic and disorganised, so not the smooth experience one hopes for on arrival. It means coming out of the taxi, navigating where to go, then schlepping up with bags to reception. These issues unfortunately were a source of disappointment. On the positive side, a lovely pool area",3 out of 5,December 2022,no hotel class found,#65 of 372 hotels in Singapore,0.1669292929292929,0.6656969696969697,58.346464646464646,66.56969696969696,16.69292929292929,Location

Amazing reviews on Google Maps, TripAdvisor, and even reddit itself. Unfortunately, I didn’t find it to be worth of 4 and 5-star ratings. The service is almost non-existent. The room is on the smaller end — I’d actually prefer Alila Bangsar in Kuala Lumpur which is the same layout but priced at 1/4 of Andaz Singapore. However, this isn’t a fair comparison. The location is also weird. The directions to the property aren’t really clear. From the MRT, you have to head on the escalators to the second floor for Andaz. Don’t get confused.

We were greeted at the checkin counter by Mr Greg. At the 1st min of our conversation, we knew we had chosen the right hotel to stay. Mr. Greg had excellent customer service; he was patient, had a great listening ear and he even managed to hold a conversation with my 3 year old son. Mr Greg gave us an excellent start to our hotel stay and it ended as an excellent one too.

Anytime b4 815am they will really chase u out when your 1 hr time is up. However pool requires no booking now so definitely much better. Another thing i love is their digital check in!

Andaz Singapore,Good (but not Great) in Almost All Aspects,"For my latest stay in Singapore I wanted to try something new and I had never stayed at Andaz Singapore before. Overall I was quite happy with this Andaz, although it was “good” in most categories rather than “great”. As Hyatt Globalist tier member I received an upgrade to the Studio Suite room type. The quality of the hardware was very good except for a few minor issues for example the plug at the bottom of the bathtub was very hard to remove so we had to rely on housekeeping to empty the tub on occasion (or use a knife ourselves), and two of the dispenser bottles broke at one point. Thankfully the hotel also provided toiletries in a gift box set so we did not run out.

Nothing was done when we are back after 1.5hrs of breakfast . If the timing cannot be kept, then what is the point of providing an option to indicate our preference.
