Four Seasons Hotel Singapore,DISAPPOINTING,"Our room was okay but dated. The bed was nice as was the bedding. The shower is powerful and great. I was very shocked that there were not separate shampoos and conditioners. They had the jugs that are now being questioned for safety and health. For a very high-end hotel I find this unexpectable. The hotel itself on the inside lobby is so grand and lovely. The rooms should match that first impression. Most of the employees are very helpful and kind. I was shocked when we first arrived by the receptionist. We had a very long day of travel and had been diving for 7 days. In other words, we were tired. I asked where we would have breakfast and she immediately retorted it wasn't included in our package. I hadn't even asked. She even gave the price of the fare!

Four Seasons Hotel Singapore,A review overdue but still deserving for one of the best hotels in Singapore!,"What can you say about the Four Seasons, Singapore. I've stayed on and off for many years (at one point for a week almost monthly for 2 years straight!) albeit it's been a while now but the Four Seasons deserves a review. Undoubtedly one of the best ""hidden secrets"" of Singapore hoteling. Elegant, discrete, luxurious. That's my sum up of the Four Seasons, Singapore. The setting is not on the hustle and bustle of Orchid Road but just one road behind which makes all the world of difference. It's like a little ""resort in a city"" (sorry about the clique) but walking distance to everything Singapore has to offer with Orchid Road about 5 minutes away and a MRT station under Tangs the other side of the road. That will bring you anywhere in Singapore!

Four Seasons Hotel Singapore,"A good stay, but lacks something...","I was a little bit disappointed by my stay at the Four Seasons. Located just behind Orchard Street, it is only a five minute walk from Orchard MRT station. Check in and out were both smooth. My room was spacious with a large, comfortable bed. Overall, the decor is nicely understated, with wood and light marble. The room had a large bathroom with separate tub and shower. Unfortunately, the shower needed some TLC, as parts of the sealant were coming off and with it, small pieces of marble. In addition, the shower handle was a little temperamental. Breakfast consisted of a large buffet with many cold and hot options from across the globe. Unfortunately, there was not enough room to sit all customers and on one occasion I was asked to sit across by the bar/cafe.

The cafe on the ground floor is just adequate and the breakfast was a 5 out of 10. There is a lounge on the 3rd floor for guests for meetings etc. and the iced tea is free, but you pay for the coffee.

After all, for a rate of over $400 USD per night, I could have easily stayed at any of the other six American Express FHR hotels located in Singapore.

Four Seasons Hotel Singapore,Top hotel,"I stayed here for a recent trip, having stayed at the Grand Hyatt on two more recent trips. I was not disappointed. The hotel staff were very attentive, responding to requests quickly, bringing fruit and juice to guests when they were by the pool, cleaning the room very well and leaving fruit in the room every afternoon. The staff were also very helpful when I lost my phone. I found the business centre easy to use, I could print off any documents I needed. Room service arrived quickly when ordered. The one thing I missed from the Grand Hyatt was yoga/pilates classes but I would still choose Four Seasons over GH. The gym had everything I would have wanted (except Kettle Bells) and was mostly empty or very quiet when I used it. I would definitely stay here again.

Four Seasons Hotel Singapore,Our favourite hotel but a disappointing stay,"This is one of the toughest reviews I have had to write. I love the Four Seasons Singapore and have been going there for 10 years - we never stay anywhere else in Singapore...up to now. We recently spent 1 week at the Four Seasons in an Executive suite. Love the room, very spacious..was a little disappointed to be right next to the lifts given our repeat business but nevertheless great room. The noise of the lifts didn't bother us but our third guest was on a rollaway in the lounge and it disturbed them greatly.

Four Seasons Hotel Singapore,Service top notch. Once renovation done will rock!,Honestly service wise this hotel was simply superb. I got sick while I was there due to humidity and aircon. The hotel went out of there way to ensure my well being. What made it so special is that all the team made a point of remembering me and knowing what I enjoy and what I don’t. For example how I like my coffee. Or suggesting herbal teas for my throat. It was like being at home with lots of Mama’s! Ofcourse the remodel is a necessary pain. Once complete will be great but for now an annoyance for guests. The location fantastic as bang off the center of Orchard Road and within the hotel you have your own high end super duper luxury Club 21 multi brand stores. The only area I wish to see an improvement is the F&B. The basics like the club sandwich AMAZING.

Four Seasons Hotel Singapore,A lovely stay !,We visited late March from London for a 4 night stay with our 2 young children. We are huge fans of Four Seasons hotels and we were not disappointed with our first stay here. The room was lovely and the hotel provided some lovely extras for the children. Bed was super comfy and the air con worked very well ! Breakfast was great with a lovely selection of high quality food.

The hotel is located in the center of a super-crowded city with crazy rhythms. It’s worth the money cause the rates are not that high but there were certain issues that you can’t avoid. The room service was always a bit late and the breakfast was average. The service was good but not like other four season hotels that we have been to , we didn’t had the feeling that we were being taken care of and this happens to many “big” luxurious hotels.

Four Seasons Hotel Singapore,Fantastic stay in Singapore,"Stayed for three nights at the Four Seasons Singapore and can't wait to return. Service was impeccable from the moment I stepped out of my car and checked-in to the moment I checked-out. The hotel is in great condition, with rooms spacious and clean. It is well-located, within walking distance of shopping (e.g. less than 5 minutes from ION Orchard) and the MRT, but still offers a calm oasis away from the traffic and crowds. One Ninety has a beautiful breakfast buffet, varying its selection each morning. The staff was wonderful, making sure that this jet-lagged, caffeine-deprived zombie turns into a human by the time she leaves for meetings. A few double shots of espresso and sufficient encouragement to return to the buffet for seconds and thirds go a long way!

Four Seasons Hotel Singapore,Four Seasons Hotel Singapore: A Class Act,"Sophisticated, elegant and understated (not flashy) - that was my impression of this hotel. Yet, with all of that there is not one person with whom I interacted at this hotel who was not friendly, pleasant and helpful. One felt like, as a guest, whatever your wishes were, the staff would see to it. The concierge desk was incredibly helpful and responsive. The breakfast buffet was great with a tremendous variety of foods and beverages. I particularly enjoyed the One-Ninety Bar where the talented bartenders could make any drink I requested, and make it well. My sleep room (one of the premier rooms) was spacious, roomy and comfortable with marble bathroom and (being a corner room) wrap-around windows almost floor to ceiling.

Staff were exceptional, room large, housekeeping went above and beyond. The restaurant was being refurbished during our stay - on day 1 it felt almost as though i had rocked up at a premier inn - a huge 'queue'. Kudos to the staff who dealt with it very calmly, efficiently and made different arrangements for the following day. The food, however, really left a nasty taste in our mouths - nobody looks forward to a hotel breakfast as much as I do, it really signifies being on holiday for me. Breakfast on both days was just a mess, the only live station was for eggs. Everything was wholly unappetizing and lacked any real appeal.

We had a special prepaid rate. Literally, the day of travel, we had a total travel snafu and couldn't leave. And the earliest we could rebook was 2 days later - cutting our trip short by 2 days - and leaving us only 2 days in Singapore. I called the Four Seasons to let them know, and they were exceedingly nice and proactively told me to not worry - that they will bill me for only 2 days and still honor the special prepaid rate that i had - even though I was calling them the day we were supposed to arrive.

Four Seasons Hotel Singapore,Exactly what you would expect of Four Seasons,"Arrived after a very long flight. Receptionist was welcoming and check in was quick and smooth. We were offered a good deal on breakfast which I deliberately hadn't included in our booking. Glad we took the deal as the breakfast was great. Large selection of everything and option of freshly cooked dishes too. Room was large, luxurious, spotlessly clean and very comfortable. Great view which was so good at night. Housekeeping was excellent. Couldn't fault anything. Every member of staff we came into contact with was friendly and helpful. We ate in 190 on a couple of occasions and enjoyed the food especially the bread they bake in house. It was superb. There are two swimming pools.

We couldn’t have been more pleased. When checking in we were upgraded from a one-bedroom suite to a Royal Suite. It was absolutely divine! There were many thoughtful touches with baby toiletries, child bathrobes, fruit and goodies at turn-down. We spent most of our time on the rooftop pool which was small but nice and had lots of kids toys. Of particular note was the excellent staff we encountered at every step - Porter’s, check-in, concierge, room service... and the housekeeping was immaculate.

Usually I would give Four Seasons properties a 5 star rating but unfortunately it slipped a bit for me this time round.

I mentioned it on the first day to the staff manning the gym but to my dismay it was still there the next day. You must realise that all over Singapore, there is this thing about cleanliness. It would be one of the cleanest cities in the world. You just have to go to Changi Airport to know what I am talking about.

Four Seasons Hotel Singapore,Four Seasons continues to be an excellent choice - simply superb in all ways,"I have been staying at the Four Seasons Singapore for the last six years or so. During that time I have also stayed at other good hotels in Singapore (of which there are plenty) but no other hotel compares for the quality of service and the truly excellent staff. There have been design changes in the bedrooms in the last year or so. Writing desks have been replaced by a side table and comfortable chair; chests of drawers have been replaced. However, when I requested a writing desk (I was in Singapore on business and needed a big surface for documents and my laptop) it was brought to the room the same day. The only drawback with the recent changes is that the closet space and drawers are now somewhat inadequate.

Four Seasons Hotel Singapore,Fantastic stay,"My friend and I split our Singapore stay in two: the first part was spent at Geylang and Katong while we finished off with the second part at Four Seasons Hotel (five nights). What a hotel! The location It's located on Orchard Boulevard, a parallel road to Orchard Road. There are two main ways to reach Orchard Road. Both are convenient although the walk along Orchard Boulevard is somewhat easier because it is straight down to ION Orchard Shopping Centre. The other walk from Four Seasons to Orchard Road through Hilton Hotel (a connected passageway) is a bit annoying because it winds a lot, up or down several stairs, around corners, so I prefer the first walk. Either way brings you to Orchard Road in just minutes: all in all a fantastic location.

Four Seasons Hotel Singapore,New favourite,"It’s really hard to fault this property. It has everything you could want and more; wonderful service, beautiful rooms, best in class f&b, and a convenient location. I really enjoyed its classic South East Asian aesthetic which felt authentically Singaporean, compared to many of the competing luxury hotels which lack local character and feel like they could belong in any city. However, the true highlight is the staff. Everyone I interacted with seemed to genuinely care about me with a level of sincerity that I’ve never before experienced in Singapore, and it often felt like I was talking with old friends.

Four Seasons Hotel Singapore,Memorable experience!,"During my first visit to Singapore, I was staying at Four Seasons Hotel Orchard Road and it was just amazing. ⠀ The room is modern, classy, very comfortable, fresh and clean.

Four Seasons Hotel Singapore,By far the BEST!! Wedding,"GWP and Shangri-la cannot come close to the service we received at Four Seasons Hotel.

One (out of many) moments that truly touched my heart was when Affandi came to offer me bedroom slippers right after the dancing.

We booked a family room with two queen beds as we were travelling with our two sons. I was worried it would feel cramped but took the gamble as we were only staying one night.

Everything was quite new and modern, including the huge flat screen television. The beds in this hotel are up there with the best I have ever slept in.

I like the location near Orchard road and appreciate the personal service the hotel gives.

We upgraded to a small suite as we were staying for a whole week, and did not regret it. Another fabulous four seasons experience. One more thing: concierge service seemed to not be en par with a typical four seasons.

The finishes were excellent, with thought and detail going into each element of the room. I did notice, however, that the building has air conditioning issues which is leading to musty smells in the rooms and a wet feeling due to humidity. The vents in the hallways were dripping with condensation causing some damage on the floors. Otherwise, I would say this is an excellent hotel, although not much to distinguish it as a Four Seasons.

Four Seasons Hotel Singapore,Excellent & unparrallelled experience,"I threw my 27th birthday party at Four Seasons. Brought my dog and about 50 friends. Felt taken care of by the hotel in every aspect. My preferences, guests, my dog were all taken into consideration. Got upgraded from one room suite to ambassador’s suite due to a last minute lack of rooms. I was very pleased to find out. Before the big day, I visited Four Seasons to look at the rooms. They patiently and graciously took us around the special rooms that were available that night. Don’t hesitate to ask to take a look. It will make you want to book it!

Four Seasons Hotel Singapore,Didn’t want to leave,"Stayed 7 nights with my husband. Upgraded ok check in for a reasonable fee that included breakfast. Room was incredible - most comfortable bed I’ve ever slept in. Huge bed, huge bathroom. Noise insulation fantastic - never heard a sound. Every member of staff is absolutely the best at what they do. Location near subway is good - although Orchard wasn’t my favourite part of Singapore. Do make sure you use the pool on level 3 - adults only and so beautiful and peaceful. One thing to bear in mind - we travelled in early July maybe this was why - quite a lot of young children at the hotel, if you’re looking for a more adult hotel I would perhaps consider this as a fact.

The rooms were exceptional, with lavish bedding and incredible amenities, as well as having an amazing breakfast. The breakfast has vegetarian and vegan options for those who need it, and is open from 6:30, which works well for people who need to fly out early (like we did). I would like to personally mention Justine and Shou Wei for their above-and-beyond service at breakfast. Absolutely wonderful people if you get the chance to see them. My only comment for improvement would be the pricing. The breakfast is incredible, but Is still quite expensive for larger groups of people (think $300 for 6 people).

And the room has some smell, it is not bad smell, bit it is not fresh. The reception I met, Miku, she is the best of the best.

You can chat with the property via FB messenger and they are super quick to reply and take action. Things like if u order food from outside, they will send it to ur room even without u asking. When u go out, just message them and ur room is clean when u get back. When u swim, they will come to give towels, cold drinks and even free dessert at times.

Four Seasons Hotel Singapore,Exceptional,"My wife and I had been to the Four Seasons Singapore for a number of conferences, so we knew the high standards to expect when we book a brief staycation for her birthday. Happy to report the hotel exceeded our already lofty expectations. Highly recommended! The customer service was exceptional: friendly and caring without being overbearing. Several special touches in honor of her birthday, and (I suppose because occupancy was presumably on the low side) an upgrade to the 1-br suite. The room was outstanding: clean, comfortable, spacious (of course). The breakfast in the restaurant was a bit pricey as you'd expect, but quite tasty.

Four Seasons Hotel Singapore,Very good tea time spot- Excellent service!,"I went to the 4 seasons bar for a tea time with a girl friend. The Bar is really comfy and nicely decorated, I loved the fact that the decoration is luxurious and the ambiance very quite and suitable for a girly chit chat. The tea time comes with sparkling teas, regular drinks and savoury/sweet mignardises. I didnt try much of the sparkling teas as I am not a bubbles fan but my friend highly enjoyed it. My white tea was delicious as was the mocha (strong and corsé like I prefer it). The food was very tasty and offered plenty of choices, I particularly loved the truffle eggs sandwich as well as the chocolate financier (would have loved to have more of these!), the scones were very well cooked and the rose strawberries jam was a nice perfect combination for the warm scones.

Four Seasons Hotel Singapore,Fab,"Stayed here for a much needed break from parenting. Not an obvious choice amongst the many staycay hotels but will definitely return. The rooms are recently refurbished so are well appointed, high quality tv's, good beds, decent coffee machine etc. The gym is excellent, obviously also a members health club but no issues there as that always means the gyms are well managed as opposed to being a token hotel gym. The hotel is deceptively big, you would never know it as you drive past, two swimming pools, two tennis courts etc. I have stayed at other four seasons and all are excellent, this is no exception. Other brands might claim to be premium in Singapore but this truly is. I will return for my next staycay.

We have stayed in many luxe hotels around the world and ultimately, a great experience at any hotel comes down to their people, the quality of their service and the F&B. The Four Seasons team in Singapore, right from the front desk to their restaurants were super warm, friendly and went the extra mile to make it a special experience for us.

The room is definitely comfortable and I liked how the toilet also has ceiling speaker installed. You are definitely not missing out in the show if you have to be in the toilet. Also, there's Airplay capability in the room TV, something which many others do not have. Breakfast wise, not as great as St Regis's but not too bad. Overall, really amazing property.

Bed and pillow was very soft and so for table. If soft wasn’t your cup of tea, can choose another from the pillow menu. Bathroom is big with separate standing shower and bath tub. Amenities were well stocked and of good quality.

Four Seasons Hotel Singapore,"Standout service with a luxurious, quiet, ambience.","Four Seasons hotel ranks high in the listings, and it isn't immediately apparent why. From the outside and in certain areas (e.g. the pool areas), the hotel is a little dated. However, all areas are immaculately maintained, while some public areas are currently under renovation and likely to be refreshed. Throughout the public areas, flower arrangements and the decor gives a garden-like atmosphere, somewhat akin to the Botanic Gardens. The bedrooms (recently renovated) are refreshingly comfortable and luxurious, without being ostentatious. Rooms are generally quiet (occasionally noise from neighbouring rooms), beds are comfortable, and capsule coffee provided. Views from the room are generally nothing to write home about, sadly.

Instead, I am just going to focus on the two things that set this hotel apart from the pack. All five-star hotels pride themselves on service.

Four Seasons Hotel Singapore,Serious issues but awesome location,"So, we had planned two x 1 week stays at FS:SG travelling with two adults and two teens. We booked interconnecting rooms and the rates were quite favourable at around 550 SGD per night per room for the first week, and about 100SGD more per room for the second room. Considering that Singapore is by no stretch of the imagination a cheap destination, it was fine. My evaluation will be be influenced by this fairly low rate paid. Upon arrival late sunday night we arrived and was set up in two rooms on a low floor (8) overlooking a construction site. The first thing we noticed was that the rooms were super humid. As in, the bedding was wet. Everything seemed wet/damp. We also had a strong smell of mildew in the adults room. The kids room was worse. It stank of cigar smoke.

Four Seasons Hotel Singapore,Good experience overall but not spectacular,"Knowing that our flight would land at Changi at 5 AM, we reached out tot he hotel about a month in advance to let them know we would be arriving extremely early to see if a room might be available. They agreed to put in the request, and did so. When we arrived (about 6AM), we were told that there was no room available. We knew this was a possibility and were prepared to wait for check-in time.

The breakfast buffet is adequate but there are better spreads at other high end hotels in Singapore. Oddly, you can’t order the eggs yourself but need to flag a waitress to put in the order.

The thing that has always attracted me to the Four Seasons has been their impeccable service. The one in Singapore also had great service but I see it deteriorating much faster; maybe because it's an older Four Season. The likes of Ritz and St Regis offer much better service at same price points. Their ""customer service"" is almost a joke now and I think (seriously) it's run by chat bots! Things like Early check in or cancelation of stay, which would often be dealt with empathy earlier now gets you a robot response.

Four Seasons Hotel Singapore,"Some little hiccups, but otherwise good","We stayed at Four Seasons Singapore during our family vacation since pre-covid times. The exact location of the Four Seasons was not in the busy Orchard Road, but rather on a more remote road which is accessible by foot on a road which wasn't very flat. Therefore it could be troublesome to come with luggage from the MRT station. Upon check-in, unfortunately it was shocking that the connecting room was not catered at the first place (luckily was given to us on the second evening onwards).

Four Seasons Hotel Singapore,"Ok Service, with some gaffes","Once, I encountered someone coughing as he came out of the lift, and i could hear him coughing along the corridor as the lift doors closed.

Thirdly, when I was checking-in, someone simply stretched out her hand to put her card on the counter, stood there for a while, before muttering ""check-out"", and left. Perhaps i was transparent and she could not see that the receptionist was serving me. Such entitled behavior.

The location is good, walking distance from Orchard road and easy for taxi or the local “grab” . The room was big enough to accommodate a family with two teenagers.. kept very clean and the bed s had crispy white sheets. Breakfast was amazing, lots of different kinds of food to choose from. The bar has some very good cocktails. We didn’t have time to try the pool and the spa…but we visited the Nobu. Wonderful service and great food…. I am glad I chose this hotel for our first stay in Singapore.

Four Seasons Hotel Singapore,Perfect !,"Marvellous - in every aspect. Location is walking distance from shopping precinct. The room is large and the house keepers have great attention to detail! I left my reading glasses and laptop out in the room and they left a fibre glass cloth with it and a mouse pad (thought that was really cute!). The body wash, soap and lotion they provide smells delicious- my husband kept saying he just wanted to eat me. The bring you an international buffet breakfast which satisfied all my cravings. The staff are lovely. Fantastic experience, and can’t wait to return !",5 out of 5,August 2023,5.0 of 5 stars,#30 of 372 hotels in Singapore,0.43392857142857144,0.582857142857143,71.69642857142857,58.2857142857143,43.392857142857146,Services
Four Seasons Hotel Singapore,A hotel that is stuck in the 90s,"I stayed at the Four Seasons Hotel - Singapore for four nights with my family. It was my first visit to Singapore, and I chose the Four Seasons due to the brand and the usual experience I am used to receiving from this hotel chain. However, the FS Singapore surely does not keep up to the high standards associated with the brand name, and was a huge disappointment. The hotel feels like it is a fancy hotel from the 90s and did not evolve ever since, in terms of rooms, and overall service. First, the rooms are very noisy from neighboring rooms and the corridor. One thing that I really do not expect from big hotel chains, is the noisiness as usually this is taken into consideration when upgrading the hotel. There is also not enough storage space within the room.
