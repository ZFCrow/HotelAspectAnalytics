V Hotel Bencoolen,Wonderful staff,"Lovely hotel, central location and excellent facilities. But the best thing about this hotel are the wonderful staff who go above and beyond to help their guests. We are late in reviewing the hotel due to my husband suffering with a serious health condition and having to be admitted to hospital for most of our stay. The staff were so helpful and supportive of our situation, and we would like to say thank you, especially to Leon, who without his support I don’t think we would have managed to get home. Happy to say my husband is now fully recovered and we hope to visit your lovely hotel again soon.",5 out of 5,March 2023,3.0 of 5 stars,#27 of 372 hotels in Singapore,0.3601190476190476,0.6636904761904763,68.00595238095238,66.36904761904762,36.01190476190476,General

V Hotel Bencoolen,Unprofessional staff,"We stayed here for 1 night because the location is good (just beside mrt). However, we arrived early before check in time and was advised they can accomodate us but they need a shout out and review for the hotel. The staff at reception got our phone and made the review on his own without our consent. Even putting 5 star for cleanliness even if it's not. Very unprofessional!
