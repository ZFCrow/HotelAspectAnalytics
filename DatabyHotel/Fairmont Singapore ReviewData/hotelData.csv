Fairmont Singapore,"Bad stay, totally uncoordinated","The counter people gave me room cards to another person's room. It was quite bad experience, with not much verification done. They basically just asked for my first name and gave me a card key. I went up and down 25 floors, 3 times as the door simply would not open. After that, the person in the room opened up the door with a very shocked face, and totally unsure what happened. Turns out we both had the same first name. Your team did give a wine to apologise, but it was not a great stay overall..",1 out of 5,October 2021,5.0 of 5 stars,#41 of 372 hotels in Singapore,-0.1358119658119658,0.4849511599511599,43.2094017094017,48.495115995116,Services,13.58119658119658

Fairmont Singapore,Fairmont Hotel A+++,Review I had a pawcation during CNY.. called a few hotels eg sofitel etc as they have pawcation but none of them can help or totally not helpful at all especially sofitel. When i called Fairmont.. the gentleman Timothy answered all my quires and even explain in detail what this pawcation package is all about.. he is extremely helpful and thus i immediately make a booking for 2 rooms Upon check in De Cheng is also another great staff and he ensure our check in is smooth. Even the technical staff which consists of a lady and a guy ( did not get their names) went all yhe way to help us solve the chromecast issue.

Firstly, the hotel is magnificent - decorated superbly, classic and luxurious. The rooms were spacious - we had a Fairmont King room, the staff went above and beyond and were so very friendly and welcoming. We ate breakfast each day at either Asian Market Cafe or Prego. Both buffet breakfasts were among the best we have experienced - the range and quality of food on offer was amazing. We also had dinner at Prego and would rate it 5 stars. Exquisite food, beautifully presented and great service. Lastly, the location is truly amazing - easy walking distance to so many attractions including the Civic District and Clark Quay, and attached to the Raffles City Shopping Arcade.

Fairmont Singapore,"Lovely hotel, great rooms and wonderful staff","The staff were so helpful and accommodating. Ace at check in was wonderful and the lovely happy gentleman that greeted staff outside Prego restaurant for breakfast each morning was beautiful, what a lovely warm man and a wonderful way to start the day with such a kind greeting. All the staff were fantastic and service from ordering taxis to getting a drink at the pool bar wonderful. The beds were also extremally comfortable and the view and room itself was perfect! My only tiny criticism is that there are no power points in the bathroom and I could not blow dry my hair! I was very confused by this as was my sister in another room who rang reception to find out where a plug was and was told there were none for safety reasons?.

Fairmont Singapore,An uneventful birthday staycation,I have just completed a one day staycation at Fairmont Singapore to celebrate my wife's birthday on the 9/2/2023. As an accor plus member I made use of the complimentary one night stay and even paid extra to upgrade to get a harbour view king room to celebrate my wife's special day. It was a forgettable and uneventful stay. From the point of check in we were informed that car park coupons were not available to guests and the concierge only provided one coupon which was valid for 24 hours. This is rather ridiculous as we are both local residents and we needed to get around from place to place. Not having car park coupons to guests means that the hotel only places emphasis on foreign travellers and not locals who wish to spend time for staycations or family time.

Or traveling out of the hotels for easily accessible F & B outlets, shopping, visiting museums, public transport with a train station nearby, you name it and you have it. Inside the hotel, the service oriented staff met and greeted you with respects. Specially applaud and mention the following staff for their good if not great services. They were friendly, helpful and served with passion and smiles. Fairmont Gold Lounge : Lydia and The Team; Nigel Jaime Chan, Howard, Syakira, Simon, Ain and Ah Lian. Front Desk : Alfie and Ryan.

Fairmont Singapore,Good enough,"The rooms at the Fairmont Singapore are spacious and beautifully appointed, with all the amenities you would expect from a five-star hotel. The beds are comfortable and the linens are of high quality, ensuring a restful and rejuvenating sleep. The bathrooms are also well-designed, featuring marble floors, modern fixtures, and luxurious la labo bath products (although they are made in Malaysia and China). While it's great that the housekeeping staff provided excellent service and took care of your messy clothes, it's disappointing with the issue with the air conditioning. It's understandable that the aircon turning off every time you go out, but resetting back to 24 degrees Celsius is extremely frustrating and annoying.

Fairmont Singapore,Comfortable but bland,"Just spent a week at the Fairmont. As everyone says, the location is perfect for all Singapore has to offer. City Hall and Esplanade Xchange subway stations can be accessed in a/c comfort beneath the hotel (the latter a bit of a walk though). The very upmarket Raffles City Mall is attached to the hotel and the more mundane but larger malls of Marina Square and Suntec are easily accessible via the same underground routes as the subway. There are numerous eateries (13 I think) shared with the adjacent Swissotel as well as the myriad of restaurants in the basement of Raffles City. Check in was smooth and personable. We had a twin room in the older North Tower and were given a high floor and a rather spectacular view as requested.

Fair enough, subsequently asked him to explain himself and he said ""I don't want to talk to you"".

The kids were pretty much finished their food before we even got our ffod, and a large group of 8 people drinking afternoon beers were sat right next us as we tried to have a quiet tea....not really a relaxing atmosphere.",4 out of 5,November 2022,5.0 of 5 stars,#41 of 372 hotels in Singapore,0.2159313725490196,0.5228991596638657,60.79656862745099,52.289915966386566,Location,21.593137254901965
Fairmont Singapore,Ismail review,"Seeing Ismail every morning for breakfast, definitely has been a highlight of most every day for the last 3 weeks. Very friendly gentleman. Definitely a spirit lifter and brings a smile to your face. He works just outside the door of Prego in the fairmont hotel. My colleagues and I were up in the Swissotel we‚Äôd meet Ismail almost every morning in his top hat and suit and exchanged cheerful two thumbs up and a smile on the way in and a handshake or a thumb up on the way out as he wished us a good day. Over all he definitely added cheer to all our breakfast experiences.

The rooms at this hotel feel extremely clean, some of the rooms have amazing views, the restaurant facilities at both the Fairmont and Swissotel are very good and both of the hotels have the ability to charge from either hotel to your room.

However, they were also unsure of the issue. Tried to connect accordi g to the steps shown but still having difficulty.

Fairmont Singapore,Fantastic stay at Fairmont Singapore,"Visited Singapore with my siblings and we stayed at Fairmont Singapore in their HarbourView King Room in South Tower facing Marina Bay Sands. The view in the morning and at night time was spectacular. There is a motorized day and night shade by the bedside if you need to darken the room for a good night‚Äôs sleep. The King bed and pillows were very comfortable, we all had a good night sleep eventhough I had jet lag for a couple of days coming from a long haul flight. The sofa and table we‚Äôve made good use for having coffee conversations. The work desk with a view of Marina Bay and Financial District was great while you catch-up on work on your laptop.

Fairmont Singapore,Very recent trip,"Just got back from a lovely stay here......my room (2001) - a basic room in the North Tower with one huge very comfortable double bed - was excellent - high ceilings and plenty of 'volume' as they say. Great view of the Marina Bay Sands. Bathroom was fine and lighting/heating good and quite easy to control too from bedside unit. Everything was available - decent shampoo and separate conditioner both of good quality, a sensible policy about sheet/towel changing, an excellent hairdryer. Just what you would want from a 'top end' hotel. So what would I change? Not much really - lovely staff - great room and of course an excellent position.

Size is quite small, amenities and everything else quite basic, but the most disappointing fact is that the power outlets are only made for Singaporean power plugs but not the variety of international power plugs.

There were some meals like vegetable fried rice which contained egg. The only problem we faced during our stay was that the wash basin in our room got clogged the night before checkout.

At least that‚Äôs what I think. The hotel is a short cab ride away from the Marina Bay. If you‚Äôre adventurous, you can walk there by navigating through the Raffles shopping center and exiting the front of the Mandarin Oriental hotel.

Subsequently, the GM, Emmanuel, found out about our situation and he came personally to have a chat with us to understand more about our feedback. He invited us to Antidotes, one of the resturant in Fairmont and we had a wonderful experience there. So thank you Fahida and Emmanuel for making an effort to keep the standard of Fairmont so high. And making sure that all residents are well taken care off. Awesome work Fairmont!

Even when you do a blood test people doing it are usually welcoming but here it was basically give me your money here are the keys now bugger off.

Had a few special requests and hotel was readily available to solve all our problems. However, one thing‚Äôs major turn off was the food. Room service food price was very high but we usually enjoy hotel food so we were willing to pay but the quality is very poor and food is bad. Ordered calamari, the batter is poorly done. Ordered ABC soup for my child, worst than all coffeeshops, they used frozen veggies with noodles and you can barely see any chicken.

We stayed at the Pan Pacific hotel 4 days prior for a change of scenery and 3 days at the Fairmont. We had our suspicions in 2019 that the quality of stay was not the same as in the past.

On arrival to the room we felt something was not quite right with several scratches on the polished floor and a kettle with bottles of water for our use.

Besides attractions, he has also assisted me in providing places in which i can dine at a minimum cost! Due to the relaxed measures, booking of pools/gyms is not required. However, i noticed the hotel provides aqua spinning so to fully enjoy the pool facility it is recccommened to avoid afternoon/evening hours.

The answer given back to me is that the PL channel is not in high demand. Secondly, it's also the only hotel in Singapore which doesn't give complimentary parking. Thirdly, the suite room we stayed comes with a water dispenser, but after multiple fix, it's just working.

What more than compensates is the excellent service throughout. At first, was given a room with twin beds when I had requested for a single king bed. I was then switched to a room where the Swisspro cabinet was not flushed against the wall making the room really claustrophobic.

For example the head board of the bed was rather worn out and peeling. So it was rather sad sight to see for such a fine establishment.

There was no complimentary carpark coupon given as the front desk [Mr. Bronze] advise that Fairmont Hotel and Raffles City shopping centre were two separate entity, and we were asked to ask the front desk everyday to see if there were any coupon which any guest do not need.

Maybe a corner near the pool while the guests swim. And an area or even an outdoor seating to allow guests to eat together with their pet rather than taking turn to go for breakfast alone while one have to look after the pet in the room.

I don't think being an accor plus member helps speed up the process - there is a counter with the accor plus signage but that's about it - it's still first come first served.

Fairmont Singapore,I have had better experience with Fairmont,"Hi, We have chosen Fairmont as our honeymoon staycation. Looking forward to enjoy our time, we had booked a 2 nights stay at Signature King Suite and also a couple massage with willow stream spa. ROOM LAYOUT - We were appalled when we arrived at a U-shaped room, where the living space is out of sight from the bed, and toilet even further out along the corridor. I would think that such segregation will be more appropriate for small family where the parents can have some downtime in bed away from the noise with the children in living and vice versa. We would have love to wire our laptop to the tv to watch our newly minted wedding video, but quickly realize that we are unable to do so in the comfort of the bed for the TV is out in the living room.

Not all hotels offer this and I do enjoy relaxing in the jacuzzi and using the steam/sauna rooms.
