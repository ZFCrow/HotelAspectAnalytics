Village Hotel Katong by Far East Hospitality,Disappointing,"Arrived at 6.30pm after 13hr flight from UK and room not ready! Supplied free drinks and snacks, but just wanted shower and sleep. Staff all very friendly, but feels as though they need more people working there. Breakfast room bit of a disaster with dirty plates around and only paper cups for hot drinks. Housekeeping didn’t come until 5pm next day when we’d just got back from day out. Overall, a good location but a disappointing experience and not what we’ve experienced from other hotels in this chain on other visits to Singapore.",3 out of 5,September 2023,4.0 of 5 stars,#44 of 372 hotels in Singapore,0.1041666666666666,0.5366666666666667,55.208333333333336,53.66666666666667,10.416666666666668,Services
Village Hotel Katong by Far East Hospitality,Great location,"Arrived middle of the night but room was ready for us. Check-in was smooth and easy. Took a family room so it was relatively large. This time it was on the opposite end of the corridor, facing towards the city rather than Parkway Parade. Could see the pool from the room. Had two huge queen beds. Empty bar fridge, which is good. However, the smart phone was no longer there. Seems like they no longer provide this. Supermarket right below the hotel, so easy to get stuff.

Village Hotel Katong by Far East Hospitality,Really bad experience,"We booked a superior double room 3 months before, specifying that it was our honeymoon. We arrived and they told us that they only had a twin room with separate beds because the double rooms were all already taken. We insisted showing our booking for a double room, they tried to sell us an “upgrade” to a deluxe double room for 140$ more (plus taxes) per night! I couldn’t believe how they were trying to scam us and ruin our honeymoon, I got really upset and after a while they said they would upgrade us to this “deluxe” room for free. Well, if that was a “deluxe” room then I must be Santa Claus, the room was old, stinking of humidity and with cheap motel-style, broken furnitures (look pictures down).

Reception staff not as helpful and welcoming as we have experienced before in Singapore but the cleaning staff always had a friendly hello.

It would be good if the hotel supplied a little map of how to get to the bus stop and which numbers go to the city centre. Breakfast offering was quite large but food quality was very average - flat noodles in a pool of oil, cold hash browns, over ripe warm cut fruit.

Village Hotel Katong by Far East Hospitality,Company Dinner Event,Village Hotel Katong is conveniently located with ample parking for guests... Our organization held a dinner event at the Saffron Ballroom in August. It was a company dinner and dance party and the ballroom had to be decorated before the event. Our organising committee was pleased that the decor team could be on site to do so a few hours before the start of the event. The ambience was ideal and the service provided by the crew was efficient. The audio facilities and equipment were sufficient and food served was of good quality. Perhaps the quantity of food could be more generous. Guests were generally pleased with the taste and presentation of the dishes and wanted more helpings.,4 out of 5,August 2022,4.0 of 5 stars,#44 of 372 hotels in Singapore,0.4857142857142857,0.6714285714285715,74.28571428571429,67.14285714285715,48.57142857142857,Location

Village Hotel Katong by Far East Hospitality,Overrated hotel,"I am shocked by the positive reviews of this hotel. I selected it based on the reviews and I was deeply disappointed. Room was too small for the $395/night price tag; bathroom tiny and does not offer much privacy with only a glass door separating you from the beds outside. The bathroom layout was strange with the toilet paper holder on the counter and directly behind the toilet seat! No place to hang clothes in the bathroom. Location is outside the city. For a lower price and with only one day notice, we got a luxury hotel, 2 bdr apartment very close to city center. Village Katong definitely over-rated in Net reviews. Finally, the breakfast was a big disappointment despite the price tag of ~ $100 for a family with 3 young children; food looked stale and unappetizing.

I decided to check it out myself. I had arrived anound 11 plus and was disappointed that the room was not available. It was raining heavily and I had nowhere to go with my kid. The reception staff Nass noticed that my Son was running around the lobby and gave me a snake and ladder game to entertain my Son. She even told me that she help out the maids to clean the room once there is a vacant room. I am glad that the board game actually kept my son busy.

The hotel makes a lot of sense for locals on staycation, but not so much for international travellers, as the area is not particularly interesting for foreigners unless you are a foodie and/or interested in Peranakan architecture.

Village Hotel Katong by Far East Hospitality,Fantastic hotel all in all,"I was initially a little unenthused about this hotel, as I had just come from another hotel in the vicinity which was newer and more upmarket. Village Katong had a less modern feel in comparison, and the rooms were not as fancy or new, and little things like lower quality toiletries added to my disappointment. But the hotel grew on me in no time. I began to appreciate the size of my room (more spacious than many city hotels) and was grateful for its practical aspects (plenty of space to put my suitcases and bags on, a long table for me to work from and strategically placed plug points). I was happy with the quality of food from the in-house restaurant as well (for Muslim travellers, note that the establishment is halal-certified).

Village Hotel Katong by Far East Hospitality,Family room for a transit night--excellent experience,"Our family of 4, 2 adults and 2 preteens needed a place to spend a night in Singapore before catching a flight the next morning. Village Hotel Katong turned out to be a great fit. It was 12 to 18 minutes from the airport depending on the time of day. The taxi fare there during rush hour was S$24, but early the next morning our ride to the airport was about S$12. Check in was smooth, friendly, helpful. The lobby was beautiful, and the elevators, hallway carpets, room, and bathroom all clean. Our family room had 2 very comfortable queen beds, a small fridge, an electric tea kettle, ironing board, free use of a cell phone during stay, and a small balcony.

Village Hotel Katong by Far East Hospitality,Disappointing,"We stayed here for 3 nights in a family room with two beds. First impression, the room we were given did not look like the advertised picture. No fancy blue bedhead, or cushions, or fancy floor rug and most disappointing of all, no bath tub. Our beds were just rested against the wall, with two small floor mats (ones that you use in the toilet) by the beds. Anyway, decor doesn't really affect my stay but disappointing mood. Overall, the negatives: - Breakfast disappointing again. I expect a lot more then just cereal, egg station, sausage, baked beans, fruits and breads. It is just a typical breakfast, nothing exciting. - Pool is small. No attendance. We were there once and no towels were available. - there was once when we came back from being out all day, the door was not",2 out of 5,April 2019,4.0 of 5 stars,#44 of 372 hotels in Singapore,-0.021875,0.3895833333333334,48.90625,38.95833333333334,2.1875,Cleaniness

The bathroom felt a bit cramped, although it was nicely designed. Balcony can't be used, as its door is permanently locked.

Village Hotel Katong by Far East Hospitality,"Excellent service, excellent hotel","Definitely one of the best hotels I have been to, from check in to room and lounge experiences, down to check out. Wendy, at the check in, was very helpful and attentive. She introduced me to the upgrade to the Peranakan Club lounge, which was simply awesome. Love the cocktail spread, which was just nice and sufficient though would have been perfect if the laksa soup was hotter. Alcohol drinkers will love it, unfortunately, both my partner and I don't drink. Room is very clean and spacious, with thoughtful touches such as total blackout curtains, a little booklet to introduce the places to go around the area and even a small bottle of mouth rinse!

All staff are very courteous and always offer assistance. I think I have some concern to be addressed here for the good sake of the hotel management as follow; 1. Staff turn-over might be high so that I see many new faces. As a repeat customer, I would expect that everybody would call me by name not sir. 2.
