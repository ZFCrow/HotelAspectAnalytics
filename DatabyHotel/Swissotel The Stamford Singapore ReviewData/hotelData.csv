Swissotel The Stamford Singapore,Expected More - Disappointed,"Stayed here for 3 nights. I'll start with the positives: - Great location, just steps away from City Hall MRT station. Plenty of food at the basement of Raffles City. - The bed is very comfortable and the view from the room facing MBS is fantastic. - Staff were generally friendly and did their best to assist us. - Prego service team were very professional. I was only there for a coffee and dessert but had a great experience. - Housekeeping very great and did well in keeping things neat and tidy. Now the negatives: - Arrival was a disaster.

Swissotel The Stamford Singapore,Not happy,"Two things: 1. The hotel staff refused to place a second baby cot in the room for our second child so that she had to sleep in our bed resulting in two terrible nights where my wife and I had no sleep at all. Multiple requests where waived with the excuse that it's not safe and secure. The room was big enough for a second baby cot without causing a safety issue, the table for example could be replaced and so many other alternatives were available. I am deeply disappointed by the attitude of the staff and unwillingness to come up with an alternative as they could clearly see and conclude that it was unpleasant for us. 2.

Swissotel The Stamford Singapore,A Birthday to remember,We will be back definitely. The surprise staycation with my kids on my birthday is one for the books. The great harbor view facing Marina Bay Sands and Merlion is definitely a must be for every family visiting Singapore. Breakfast and lunch are a feast not to be missed. Love the hospitality of the team from the concierge to the shuttle attendant. Foodcourt at the basement connecting with other hotel reminds me of Hongkongs Marco Polo hotel.

Swissotel The Stamford Singapore,Great Location,"Stayed there on a business trip in October 2022. Great location, spacious rooms. Loved the view of the harbour. Stunning! It there is something to criticise, it would be the breakfast. It was ok but I feel there should be more hot items on the buffet. Also the one size coffee/tea cup fits all is not ideal when you want to drink an espresso.

Swissotel The Stamford Singapore,Short Stay,We had a very short stay here of only 2 nights but the staff were incredible. We were greeted by a self checkin system which was amazing and handled very well. One member of staff went out of his way to get a soft toy for each of my girls which was such a lovely touch and we were so pleased with. The location is amazing - you are right in the CBD surrounded by things to do and the room was so spacious for 4 people. Our only hiccup was our washing was taken from our room without our consent (we hadn't filled out any of the paper work only used the laundry bag to keep things seperate) but the hotel compensated us for this rather than charging as it wasn't something we had requested.

Breakfast was in one of 2 venues and the main one (Clove) often had a long line up to get a table. Weekends were a complete mess with locals enjoying a staycation and adding to the numbers.

Swissotel The Stamford Singapore,Fantastic hotel and location,We stayed as a family of 7 in your hotel in 3 rooms. The stay was very comfortable. Room size was good. It would have been good if we were able to lower the aircon as it was very hot for our family as the air con is set to a specific temp set by the hotel. However we did find there was too much confusion with check in and check out particularly with the self-service and the monitors set up in the lobby - there was no order and people who came after us were served before us. We didnt find any cleaning taking place in between people accessing the monitors and checking in/out. We also had breakfast each morning we were there. While the options offered are the same with a few minor changes each day it does get a bit boring having breakfast there every day so we opted to go out,5 out of 5,October 2022,5.0 of 5 stars,#62 of 372 hotels in Singapore,0.1551388888888889,0.4923611111111111,57.75694444444445,49.23611111111111,Services,15.513888888888891

Swissotel The Stamford Singapore,A little disappointed,This was part of a big trip for us. There is a check in which seemed to be more geared to those who spend their lives on a phone. To be honest as a couple I think we got a poorer service than those who came to conferences here. We were on our last day when we were able to get our membership validated due to the business of the hotel. Although at one stage we were flicked away with a hand to look for someone else. We were similarly dismissed when an outside door man felt he would be better served ignoring us and concentrating on corporate guests.

Swissotel The Stamford Singapore,Fantastic photo in great location,You are greeted by friendly and accomodating staff. I arrived from Europe about seven hours before check-in but was welcomed warmly and in a room on the 48th floor within minutes of arrival. The room (Harbour View) was very modern and up to date and had amazing views of Singapore. Amenities are first class. The hotel is in a great location and has a four level shopping centre adjacent. Breakfast was in a lovely restaurant called Clove and was buffet with so many food options (East and West). You can do better than enjoying a Singapore Sling by the hotel pool either! Check out was very smooth and staff go out of their way to assist. All in all a great hotel to stop and have a relaxing couple of days en route back home to Australia.

Swissotel The Stamford Singapore,Great location and a nice view,"Great hotel with a excellent location. Spacious rooms and good housekeeping. Only truly disappointing experience was the breakfast room. Every day there was a long lineup just to be seated. Not due to lack of space, but due to understaffing of the seating procedure. The breakfast buffet held everything you could wish for, but the buffet was crowded and the egg station was mostly only manned by one and with a wait of 10 minutes just to put your order in.

The was a problem with queuing, a que for the omelette station that varied between 4 and 10 people during my 5 breakfasts here and more than occasional queues to entre for breakfast. Could the two be linked i.e., people being seated but not eating because they were queuing for their egg and table blocking the breakfast restaurant.

Swissotel The Stamford Singapore,Good but could be better,We had stayed many many times before at the Swissotel til around 10 years ago so we were interested to be back. You can check in online in advance which does speed check in up which is great. We had always stayed in Executive Rooms before and did this time too. There is a difference tho compared to before. They have added lots and lots more executive rooms with the result that our room was not on 'curve' of the hotel as before. View was therefore not as good. Executive Lounge is now an entire floor compared to the small one before. Canapes in the evening time were good but alot of the dishes were not hot enough. Service was excellent tho especially Ria who always had huge smile for us....she was there 10 years ago and it was lovely to see her again.

When I stepped in to the lobby, there was a desk filled with computers, there were guests from overseas look lost too and needed assistance for the check in. Quite a few wasn't sure which to q and some computers were off. Next, we were disappointed by the water pressure from the bathroom. It took almost 30 min to fill up the bathtub. (Not sure was it because of sustainability). The room was also quite dusty. The surprise cake was good for my birthday. The view was nice. Overall, for paying a x amount of money for the stay with such standard I find it hard to accept.

Swissotel The Stamford Singapore,Stop Over after a NYC - Europe Holiday,"We stayed for the first time at the Swissotel the Stamford in July 2023 on our way back from Europe. The room we stayed in was an executive suite located on the 60th floor with access to the Executive Lounge. The Room was excellent with views of the Marina as well as MBS and a lot of iconic places around the waterfront in Singapore. An added benefit of our stay was to watch the rehearsal of the National Day Parade for 2023 which for us wa on 29 July 2023. A word of warning, window seats are sniffled very early, so plan if that‚Äôs your go. Our room also had an excellent view proceedings as well.

Swissotel The Stamford Singapore,Unforgettable Stayca!,"It's my first time at the hotel and it has surpassed my expectations. Firstly, check in was very smooth even though it was the national day rehearsal day. Secondly, the Swiss Harbour room we booked was wonderful. It's huge, clean and inviting. I was half-expecting outdated furnishings since the hotel has been around for a long time. But seems like the outdated one is me. It is modern and the super King bed made me fall asleep so quickly. Thirdly, the balcony has a see-through glass panel, allowing us to have a perfect view of the Padang even when inside the room since it can get chilly outside at times. Checking-out was extremely efficient with a press of a few buttons on the email we received just before check-out.

Overall, a very pleasant experience, however there are a few points which I hope hotel management would take note of and address: 1.

Only 5am onwards it would get colder - not sure why this is 2. Improve your wifi speeds, the wifi is stable but it's only 25Mbps, whereas other hotels are up to 100Mbps. 3.

Swissotel The Stamford Singapore,A modern luxury hotel,According to many if the hotel has a lavish lobby and royal rooms and many restaurants it IS CALLED A 5 star. I sincerely disagree. I believe if the staff is courteous and concerned about the guest in the most respectful manner only then can a hotel gain more importance. Thence the only downfall based on my last sentence is that this hotel has a staff which is not attentive to the needs of the guests. Everything else was superb in every possible way. The tennis court at the 11th or 17th flooor if I am not mistaken are very well maintained . Food services are good.

Swissotel The Stamford Singapore,Great location,We spent a couple of day here before our cruise and the stay was terrific. The buffet breakfast was fantastic with so much to choose from. I am gluten free and they had a dedicated area including toaster and bread (which was really good!). the food is refreshed regularly in the buffet so I was able to select from the dishes without a high risk of cross contamination. my fellow travellers loved the wide variety available every breakfast. With the hotel being located over the City Hall train station and a big shopping complex we were able to shop and travel with ease.

Swissotel The Stamford Singapore,Loved every second of my stay,Had been here from 31st March to 4th April and it was such a pleasant experience. The room I stayed was on Floor 37 and the views of the city from there is simply amazing. However since i was there for a company event the food that was served was mostly for a group and so it had its ups and downs which could be understood considering we were a large group so no complaints there. The room was absolutely fantastic. Since it was a first time for me to find so much of automation in the room it was quite nice. There's mood lighting in the room and the bathroom was squeaky clean. I have to tell you I loved my stay there and felt that the hospitality inspite of the size of our group was simply exceptional. Keep it up Swissotel!!

Swissotel The Stamford Singapore,Rather average and not 5 Star.,"We arrived, very jetlagged, to find a self service check-in....just like McDonalds. Fortunately there was a lady wandering around this area who could help. Our luggage had already been taken by the porter. When the porter brought our luggage we had no Singapore cash (having arrived straight from the airport) to tip him. He made it quite obvious that he was not impressed, muttering under his breathe as he left. Our room, for 3 people only had 2 towels. Even cheaper hotels usually have spare towels. The coffee in the coffee machaine was deplorable, and they had 3 capsules of 'coffee cream' and a few sachets of powdered creamer....which you usually only find in cheap motels. Disgusting stuff.

The breakfast at the restaurants can be busy...we preferred the lounge access which came with the suites.

Very central and is connected to raffles centre and another hotel. Check in was a little chaotic with the self serve however plenty of staff around to assist.

We waited over 25 minutes for a taxi to night safari and after almost getting into a fight with other patrons of the hotel who weren‚Äôt waiting at the appropriate waiting area the doorman told us to go to the hotel around the corner to get a cab as they don‚Äôt come to the Swiss√¥tel as often.

We stayed in a Premier King Harbour View and the 'King' was huge, more than enough room for 2 adults and a toddler to sleep comfortably without touching each other, we did intend to get a cot but found it easier this way with a jetlagged little one. I'm not great with heights and of course we ended up on the 33rd floor, but the view was stunning.

Swissotel The Stamford Singapore,A good hotel but a few negative experiences,"We have been 2 times before in this hotel. The big plus is that the hotel is centrally located at a MRT station and a mall. And because of his height it offers spectacular views. The rooms are refurbished and look very good. We booked a Crest Suite. The room offers everything a spoilt traveller would like: automatic curtains, two toilets, one of them with a shower & dry function, the functioning of the lightning is state of the art and the beds are really really comfy and big. The rooms comes with access to the L65 lounge. The staff is very friendly, however, sometimes we had the idea the staff is a bit over-intstructed to be friendly.

It was ridiculously distasteful and felt like as if the previous day's meal was heated up and thrown in onto the plate. I was very hungry and had to leave for work urgently, but it took 40 minutes to deliver that kind of horrible breakfast. It was downright appalling for the kind of money which is about 400 SGP per day and the food obviously was on the expensive side as well.

Improvements: no desk to work in the room, you only have a round table and I am not a fan of doing my own check-in/check-out on the computer.

Swissotel The Stamford Singapore,Disappointing Start - Satisfying End,"Going into this trip, I had very high expectations of Swissotel The Stamford. But I was utterly disappointed during check-in. A few days before check-in, I communicated through email with the room reservation team regarding decorations for my wife's birthday. I was surprised that they had to charge me for a simple decoration but I was fine paying it and gave them clear instructions to proceed with the decoration. However, during check-in, I was informed by the check-in staff there were no instructions on decoration.

Our room was a good size well designed automatic night-lightings if you need to answer the call of nature in the night and comfortable with iconic views of Singapore's waterfronts and the financial area.

Swissotel The Stamford Singapore,Not bad - could be better,"Started badly. We arrived early for check in as we disembarked from a cruise ship. The good news, our rooms were ready! The bad news, they weren't the Premium Harbour View rooms we had booked and barely had a view of the harbour. Back to check-in to be told we could change rooms if we waited until 3pm - normal check in time. This was fine as we could easily kill a few hours. Second attempt at checking in and we were told we would be on a different floor to our friends as the hotel was full and this was the only way we could get 2 Premium Harbour View Rooms. This was annoying as we had booked the rooms in January for our November stay. I pointed out that there was no way the hotel was full in January for a stay in November.

The night light system is the best I have seen. Motion activated with a timer, so you can keep the room dark to sleep and nothing too bright if you wake up and move around at night. Blackout curtains are excellent. Not so good: I could not figure out how to take a shower without soaking the floor of the bathroom. That is a particular annoyance for me. I was on the 10th floor, which is fine, should be off the street. Traffic noise was constant. There is a bar-restaurant across the street that started playing booming music in the evenings, with a lot of base.

The blackout curtains do their job very well. Sadly, the room lighting violates enough light hygiene rules to provide my solitary ding on the otherwise great venue: The alarm clock can at lest be unplugged. The TV's red LED felt like the Eye of Sauron was staring at me through my sleep. This was matched by a triple of green LEDs attached to other devices in the room, including the blinking one attached to the fire system.

Swissotel The Stamford Singapore,A place that make you feel more than welcome.,"Firstly, the best asset of the hotel is the staff. Especially the staff at level 65. Miriam, Devynna (if I get the name right) and Adikin are superb and friendly. No matter how busy they are, they still put on their smile and fulfill all of the guests‚Äô requests. Check in is smooth at level 65 as we have have booked the signature suite room. We were upgraded to the nice vitality room. The room is equipped with some simple exercise equipments that somehow forced us to work a little ‚Äúharder‚Äù in keeping ourselves in shape during our stay there. It was a pleasant and great stay for us and surprisingly even with covid 19, the hotel is rather full. I guess this shows how good the Swissotel reputation is in the industry.

We thoroughly enjoyed our time at the Swissotel on Stamford.

Our room was on the 38th floor, it was spacious and very comfortable, although the beds seemed smaller than double beds. Our view over the city was breathtaking. The pool area was pleasant and there were never any issues finding a sun lounge. The best thing about this hotel is the location, so many attractions are a short walking distance away.

Swissotel The Stamford Singapore,Not perfect but damn close!,"This was the last hotel in a long list as we travelled from Spain via London to Australia and back. It may have been the last but, on balance, it was the best. But first the negatives, albeit minor. The so-called self-service check-in and out is chaotic and off-putting as you arrive. It neither engenders a warm welcome on arrival nor a warm, happy feeling of being a valued guest on departure. It's not self-serve but you're expected to do it yourself under a member of staff's watchful eye. After a long journey, rather than being expected to work under supervision, I like to be welcomed by a pleasant receptionist behind her desk, doing it for me whilst, ideally, I sip a complimentary drink in the bar.

The breakfast was first class with many choices. My only reservation was the price of the food in the hotel restaurants. With the competition for food outlets in Singapore, I'm surprised that any of the guests at the hotel dine in their restaurants. Adjacent to the hotel is Raffles City. There are restaurants on the ground floor that cater for every possible taste at a fraction of the hotel prices. After saying this, I suppose if you stay at a 4-5 star hotel you should expect to pay prices that reflect the status. In a nutshell, it is a first class hotel with first services.

Check in was very smooth and our cases, taken when we got out of the taxi, were already on their way to our room. I wasn‚Äôt too happy with the view from our room and called guest services to see what could be done - a few moments later a knock on the door and we were offered another room with a far better view. The room was very spacious and probably had the best pillows I have ever used - just so comfy. Bed was huge and also very comfortable indeed. Plenty of hanging space and why don‚Äôt other hotels have their room safes in a drawer opening upwards?

Swissotel The Stamford Singapore,14 days,"So I did my 14 day quarantine at this hotel. This hotel is incidentally where my high school prom was held, so it felt somewhat nostalgic to be back after all these years. I genuinely enjoyed my quarantine - the room was large and lovely and there was a balcony. It felt wonderful to be able to step onto the balcony and feel the hot and humid Singapore air (!) I requested vegan food and the staff tried their best to accommodate. Some meals were a hit while some were a miss (e.g. cold oatmeal with no toppings/a few slices of dry bread with jam). I loved the balanced Indian meals and the veganised local dishes (sweet and sour mock meat and even Omni meat).

However, things became a lot better when I received a call from duty manager, Renan. Everyone I had met since I landed back home -- from airport immigration to hotel front desk -- were just simply doing their job and ticking off check-boxes. They were 'efficient'.

However, the hotel was full house so they exercised the option NOT to take us in as they are running full. I went to Front Desk to lodge a complaint but was told she cannot do anything as it was different departments - 'Hey... guests just see you as ONE hotel!'

Swissotel The Stamford Singapore,Less than stellar,"The room has a lovely view. The sheets are nice. But there are some lapses for a five star, luxury hotel. The line to check in can look like Disneyland, with velvet ropes and an endless twisting queue. the hotel has 1250 rooms and should have a plan to deal with this so that checkin is speedy. We arrived late after a full day of travel. To get a roll away for our son took four requests and more than an hour. We were exhausted by the time it finally showed up. The AC in the rooms will not go below 70-degrees Farenheight/21-degrees Celsius, which is hot for sleeping under covers. No other hotel on this trip limited AC in this way.
