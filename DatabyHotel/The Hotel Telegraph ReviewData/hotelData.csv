The Hotel Telegraph,Underwhelmed... Expected More.,"I must say I was quite underwhelmed with my experience at Hotel Telegraph. Right from the beginning, the experience was just 'average'. The taxi dropped me off from the airport (theres 2 entrances which is quite confusing) and there is no assistance with your luggage - No bellboy etc. This is surprising - isnt it a 5 star? I expected help - esp as I was paying $300 per night. The room was ok... Nothing fantastic - typical of a 4 star (not 5) hotel I would say. The breakfast was also nothing special. I struggled to get excited about going down to eat and ended up having 1 of my 4 brekky's on offer. The only good thing is location. Its quite central and an easy walk to Raffles Place, Boat Quay, China Town etc. Would I go back? For the price I paid, definitely not. I would",3 out of 5,September 2023,5.0 of 5 stars,#68 of 372 hotels in Singapore,0.16935107376283848,0.5252567693744165,58.467553688141926,52.525676937441645,16.93510737628385,Services
The Hotel Telegraph,Great Location,"The hotel is in a great location, situated close to a variety of MRT lines and bus stops. Best of all, it is located right beside the wonderful Lau Pa Sat Hawker Market. After enjoying the many delights of the market you don't have far to waddle back to your room. The hotel is located in a heritage building but is very modern inside. The decoration is bright and welcoming. The reception staff are efficient. The bellboys are wonderful, providing a cheery welcome every time that you return to the hotel. We stayed in a Balcony Suite. It was spacious with comfortable furnishings and a great bathroom. The soundproofing could be improved. We could hear the sound of the televisions in the rooms on both sides of us. Whilst it was not very loud it was still an intrusion.

The Hotel Telegraph,"Insolent manager, no response to emails and phone calls","I had the most unpleasant and unhappy experience, my first ever, in dealing with someone who is ill-mannered and ill-trained in the hospitality industry. Dhirah is the reservation manager and the supervisor of a staff who made multiple mistakes. Dhirah did not take ownership of the mistakes, blamed it on technical glitch, did not apologise and to top it all, she got into an argument with me, a guest. I asked for the mistake(s) to be rectified but she stood firm that she was not going to do it. Dhirah has previously asked me to do my own bookings online. I am a paying guest, there is a reservations team, I was thinking why I cannot enlist the help of the reservations team. On their hotel website, reservations@thehoteltelegraph.com is given.

The Hotel Telegraph,Singapore Sings,"From the time our cases were unloaded at the front entrance to when they were reloaded three days later our stay at the Hotel Telegraph was amazing. Concierge, reception, restaurant and bar staff elevated our Singapore experience to the highest level. The room was very comfortable and our package include daily drinks and canapés which were delicious. Loved the rooftop bar and pool area also. A big shout out to Rochelle and Muhamed who looked after us so well when were dining.

The Hotel Telegraph,Great hotel at the heart of Singapore with some improvement needed,"Strategically located next to Lau Pa Sat and SGX building, the legacy of F.G. Lundon from 1927 stands elegantly among the Singapore skyscrapers. The newly-renovated building itself offers a clean and cozy feeling with perfect conditioning among the heat of Singapore. I also felt like home with all the services that they offer to me and I was constantly in awe with the architecture and interior. The hotel applied pre check in form that was sent to my phone, so I could fill all the details and straight to the reception to receive my room key. However, due to their system change, they gave me separate key for lift and the room (they say it should be temporary and I hope it will be fixed as soon as possible).

The Hotel Telegraph,Terrible condition of hotel rooms!,"The worst hotel in Singapore ever! Photos doesn’t match reality. Hotel rooms are old and dirty, personal is rude, administration doesn’t pay attention for guests requirements. We won’t be able to stay here because price and quality are not comparable. No one offers the refund, even 50% of payment amount.

The Hotel Telegraph,Enjoyable stay in Singapore.,"The hotel was situated in the business district of Singapore but not far from shops and subway, and is only two or three stops from major Singapore attractions. Breakfast was great and included in the price, and we dined there twice - both times with excellent meals, with one gluten free. The rooftop infinity pool was great for laps in the early morning and in the afternoon, due to the close proximity to the Sate vendors, one could smell the fires starting up!",5 out of 5,May 2023,5.0 of 5 stars,#68 of 372 hotels in Singapore,0.29875,0.6575,64.9375,65.75,29.875,Location

The Hotel Telegraph,LOVED this Hotel - we will be back!!!,"Well we're 2 nights down into a 4 night package here at the Telegraph and we couldn't be more impressed! From the time we arrived from the airport to check-in to the dining room ALL staff have been nothing but helpful and professional! Special thanks to our waiter Khairul who was amazing and very attentive!!! Now to the room! We chose to upgrade from a Cosy Room (standard as part of our package) to a Mini Suite and we're very happy we did! Even though our room is on the first floor and right on the corner of a busy intersection, we cannot hear any traffice noise! The room itself is beautiful! It's a very odd shape but that just adds to the charm and understandable when you know the building was the home of the Telegraph company when it was built in the 1920's!
