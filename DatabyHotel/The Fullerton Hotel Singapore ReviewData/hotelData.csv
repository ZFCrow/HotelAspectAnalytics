The Fullerton Hotel Singapore,Excellent service recovery,"Belated review as I stayed at TFH Heritage room for one night (with late checkout) in April 2021. We were given a corner room so the room and bathroom were extremely spacious. The room was generally very clean, but we found trash (likely from previous guest) hidden behind the curtains. Which brings me to my point about their service. When we found the trash I called for housekeeping, and though it was late at night, they still came quite quickly. I was expecting just one staff to come clean up, but two of them showed up to apologise. And I thought that was the end of the incident. But when I checked out, one of the front desk managers (sorry I don’t remember her name anymore!) voluntarily came up to me to offer her apologies, contact details and a Fullerton Bear!

The Fullerton Hotel Singapore,Overrated hotel during peak season,"Visited the hotel in Nov, 2 days after my birthday. Went at 10am to drop my luggage and the bellboy service was excellent, the best of the day. Completed the check in formalities and told to return at 3pm for a room. The rest of the trip gone downhill from there. Upon check in, given Quay Room. However, the room was small, and did not have a balcony. Went back to check back with the receptionist, after 1 hour, and 3 calls, no updates. Went back to the front desk, only to be told that the rooms are all full. I wonder how they allocated those rooms with balcony, as i had paid more for the quay room, to get one with better views and a balcony, only to be told nothing was available, despite coming in at 10am and signed up for their membership programme. returned at 6pm to find a",2 out of 5,November 2021,5.0 of 5 stars,#9 of 372 hotels in Singapore,0.2916666666666667,0.4708333333333334,64.58333333333334,47.083333333333336,29.166666666666668,Services

Check-in: It took awhile and although the afternoon tea while we waited was good, we really wanted to go swimming instead of wait for a long time before we could check in. Pool: After finally finishing the check-in process, we were able to go to the pool. Upon entry, we were informed by staff that it is crowded. Why then, would you book more people in if that is the case? Especially with covid, people shouldn't have been packed into the smaller-than-in-other-hotels pool.

Given Fullerton's reputation, some proactiveness on offering things such as complimentary parking and choice of pillows to guest without us asking would have made it 5 stars for service.

The Fullerton Hotel Singapore,Expected better,Stayed in the Heritage Room for 2 nights. The staff were not friendly at all. Everyone just ignored us from the moment we got off the car until the check in counter (which was a bit hard to find) and not even a single greeting. No one cared to offer any assistance when we were trying to look for the check in counter with our huge bags and we had to ask around. The room we got was smaller than the photos and the bed was positioned at a weird angle. The pillows were flat. Nespresso coffee machine did not work at all.

The Fullerton Hotel Singapore,Staycation converts,"Service was wonderful right from the very beginning. To ensure that the check in process was smooth, we received a call to ask when we’d be arriving and we were also offered an upgrade. The room, we were told had not undergone a recent refurbishment that other rooms have had but on top of the room being several grades above the original booking we’d made, we’d be given an early check in. I was honestly a bit leery and worried having seen how tired hotel rooms could get. However, the promise of the view of the bay was too tempting and so we took the upgrade. We were so impressed by how clean and well kept everything was. The towels were white and fluffy. We had a view of the bay and it was lovely to see the sunrise from the room.

Everything is gorgeous from the lighting to the furniture to the bathroom fixures, and impeccable staff are everywhere you might need them. Best of all is the location which makes nearly every downtown trip walkable even in Singapore heat. I would just note that because this hotel is fitted to what was previously a post office, there are some design compromises, particularly in the rooms which are smaller than other Singapore hotels, and many rooms are interior facing to the vast lobby, thus receiving less natural light. The lifts are a bit slow as there aren't so many available.

The moment I stepped within 50 metres from the hotel I could feel that this one is gonna be different, it has been a while since I last stepped into a hotel ever since ahem ahem (you know), but everything at The Fullerton made me feel like the travel scene has never left! The place was lively, the lobby was filled with people, the lounge was almost full house, there was even a short queue at the front desks! (It was really a very short wait so don’t be alarmed by that hahaha) the front office agent was able to answer every need and queries that I had raised, of course as expected, the check in process was super efficient and I was in the elevator up to my room in minutes.

I stayed here as apart of ht AMEX promotion that I was offered a free night here and I took it. What struck me first was how useless the doormen were. I dont understand why they are there when they watch you take your bag out of the car. While this isnt a problem, they did watch me, something which I find uncomfortable if they see me. I then at check in asked for an upgrade at check in, with the AMEX promotion offering me an internal courtyard room. I wasnt a room that had an outdoor area, I was offered an Esplanade room for 50++ and then offered a Collyer Quay Suite for 300++. i took the former, having been promised it had an outside aea, and WOW, it had solid brick walls in front of the windows.

On arrival to our room realised that the courtyard room had no natural direct light and asked for alternates with direct light and was moved to an outward facing room for a very reasonable amount extra with ease. Facilities ie gym were great, swimming pool was nice but not many beds and you can’t order food which was frustrating when relaxing at the weekend before leaving but equally not a deal breaker (drinks can be served).

The issue being we had to take the last room that seemed to be available, it was hot and unrenovated on level 4. Sadly the hotel was fully booked due to the Grand Prix lead up. The room was oversized and a window which if you stood on a chair it has a view. We just couldn’t resist to take a photo as my husband is ‘6.4’. Overall we liked our stay but the last night stay was substandard for the price tag.

The Fullerton Hotel Singapore,Fantastic Hotel!!,"Amazing hotel with amazing service! Checkin was flawless and the room was well appointed. No refreshing needed in the room as everything was neat, clean, and not showing any signs of wear and tear. Mini bar and snacks were great. For breakfast, the cafe in the lobby was good. No complaints whatsoever ever. If you are looking for old world charm with newer amenities, this is the place to stay. For guests, two things to consider, there isn’t a hotel “gift” shop so if you need meds, drinks, snacks, there is a 24 Hr 7-11 less than 10min walk. Also, I did have a terrible experience at the Spa, but not holding that against the hotel given it is separate. Be very careful when booking any service with the spa.

The Fullerton Hotel Singapore,Fabulous position and beautiful rooms,This was a lovely hotel and very well positioned in Singapore. We stayed in a gorgeous suite with lovely amenities. I’ve given it 4 stars instead of 5 but only for one reason and I understood completely why there was an issue. There was no bar in the hotel to come back and have a drink in after dinner and we couldn’t get a cocktail pre dinner. This was peculiar for a five star hotel of this size. We asked a member of staff why the bar was closed and they explained that they were struggling to get enough staff post-covid so couldn’t open the bar. This is understandable in the circumstances but perhaps they could have deployed one or two members of staff from other areas or suggested we get a drink from the restaurant. It was only 9.30pm so it’s not as if we were looking to stay,4 out of 5,September 2022,5.0 of 5 stars,#9 of 372 hotels in Singapore,0.14791666666666667,0.5479166666666667,57.395833333333336,54.79166666666667,14.791666666666666,General

The Fullerton Hotel Singapore,Super Hotel with a few niggles,On early arrival on a very damp September morning with high expectations we were slightly deflated not to get an immediate early check in but this was tempered by the coffee and cake provided by a very kind staff member. We were allocated our room at 10.30 and had to pay a £660 pre authorisation that I felt was a little unreasonable . However that was the downside as the remainder of our stay was memorable. Our room was luxurious and had super views of the Quay and every item one wished for was to hand. The concierge even provided umbrellas. The breakfast buffet was excellent and the whole team worked extremely hard.

The Fullerton Hotel Singapore,Great location and grand hotel,Stayed for 5 nights in a premier courtyard room. Room was refurbished. Bathroom was huge by Singapore hotel standards. I kept the curtains closed most of the time. I picked the Fullerton because I like hotels that have character. A lot of 5 star hotels in my opinion are soulless and the same. The location was fabulous for the things that interest me. Being so close to the Merlion and waterways was great. The train station is so close as well. The staff that stood out for me were the concierge and front door man. Sharing tips on quickest transportation routes etc. Breakfast was plentiful but I do wish it went to 11am instead of 10:30am.

A fantastic bluetooth speaker and an out of this world toilet that has to be seen to be believed (yes.... it is that good!). My children were so well accommodated too. Little welcoming gifts and a scoop of ice cream each day just added to the experience. My son is autistic and often has odd behaviours but the staff treated him with kindness and respect.

The Merlion is just across the road, Boat Quay and Lau Pa Sat are a stone's throw away and the subway is steps away and brings you to many places. Even Sentosa is within easy reach from the Fullerton. I do believe it has the best location in Singapore. 2) it has a great view of Marina Bay Sands from the room if you get the bay view rooms. I love the river view as much if the pool area is any indication.

Basically I couldn’t get a straight answer and found this member of staff ‘Hope’ grumpy, unnecessarily rude and unhelpful with a very condescending and dismissive attitude. She then appeared to be complaining about me to a fellow staff member",3 out of 5,December 2022,5.0 of 5 stars,#9 of 372 hotels in Singapore,0.07208333333333335,0.48500000000000004,53.604166666666664,48.50000000000001,7.208333333333335,Services

This round I went with another mother and two 5 years olds and a 1 year old toddler.

The accommodating and helpful staff from concierge to reception to dining place made our trip almost stressless (can’t be none with a toddler).

The Fullerton Hotel Singapore,A great experience in Singapore,"We had the pleasure of visiting Singapore in April 2023 and staying at The Fullerton Hotel. The experience exceeded all of our expectations. The Fullerton is located adjacent to Marina Bay, so we were able to take advantage of numerous nearby attractions.

The hotel's attention to detail extended even to its fragrant ambiance, as it always smelled delightful.

The Fullerton Hotel Singapore,Possibly the best hotel I have ever stayed at...,"This has to be one of the best hotels I have ever stayed at in my life. Big compliment ...but I do not exaggerate. Let me explain-- yes the hotel is old-style gorgeous with a red carpet, incredibly beautiful lobby, doorman, luxurious rooms, a breakfast that was out of this world and literally had dishes from every part of the world... but what made it incredible was the unbelievable attention to detail ... from the moment you enter, until the moment you leave. The afternoon tea was a delight...

The Fullerton Hotel Singapore,Extraordinary Service by Malo!,Thé location was superb! The historic building is outstanding! We arrived very early morning at 6.30 am. After a 16 hours flight from SFO .. a little bit exhausted … They already knew our early arrival because we booked a limo way in advance with the service of limo of the Hotel. Our rooms (2) were not available…. During our 6 hours wait in the courtyard nothing was offered to us or any communication was done. To our disappointment .. we learned one day later that we could have enjoyed the Spa .. showers ..etc.. For people staying 10 days ..they could accommodate a bit better..!! The Quay room was very small but charming. The housekeeping MARY on the 3 rd floor delivered an outstanding work everyday and we appreciate their professionalism and their friendliness.

The Fullerton Hotel Singapore,Excellent Location with Quality Service,"Just spent 11 days at The Fullerton and stayed in 4 different rooms, from the Palladium Suite, River Quay View, Marina Bay View & the River Pool view rooms.

This classic building has a lot to share for the explorer with connecting underground airconditioned subway for convenience getting to The Fullerton by The Bay a Hotel. The service from the staff was excellent, always wanting to go that extra mile to help. Get in nice and early for buffet breakfast with a choice of inside or outside dining. The pool is great though of coarse certain parts of the day are the busiest. Taxis are accessible via the front entrance, just ask the Valet.

The Fullerton Hotel Singapore,A wonderful stay at an exceptional hotel,"We visited as a Mum and daughter 7 night holiday and loved our experience staying at The Fullerton. The location is perfect - a hawker market, lots of restaurants, galleries, etc in easy walking distance as is Merlion Park. Our room was lovely, very comfortable beds, etc.. We had a courtyard view and would ideally seek a view next time. In saying that we knew exactly what we’d booked for and didn’t spend much time in the room, instead making the most of the amenities the hotel has to offer including the beautiful swimming pool. It’s also worth noting the reciprocal benefits in being able to use The Fullerton Bay hotel swimming pool which is also gorgeous and has a stunning view. Our package included the buffet breakfast which was fantastic. It really had everything you could",5 out of 5,September 2023,5.0 of 5 stars,#9 of 372 hotels in Singapore,0.4972549019607843,0.6504901960784314,74.86274509803921,65.04901960784314,49.72549019607843,Location
