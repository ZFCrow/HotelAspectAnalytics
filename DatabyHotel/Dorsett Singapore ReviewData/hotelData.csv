Dorsett Singapore,Disappointing,"The first room I was given was dirty, damp and mouldy. But reception didn’t argue when I asked for another room. However, even the new room was dated and tatty.

Dorsett Singapore,"Filthy, disgusting, and worn down.","This place is a DUMP. Its big but everything is old and tacky (and not in a cute kitsch way). Most importantly though, its FILTHY. The hallways/elevator? Filthy stained carpets covered in trash and food particles and clumps of dust. Then we got to our room! First off, its much tinier than expected. But what hit us first was the solid wall of hot, stuffy, stale air. The A/C was off and our room was a stifling 26 degrees celsius. We discovered you could only turn on the air by inserting your room key. No matter though - even running all night set to 17 degrees it never got below 21.

Dorsett Singapore,Recommend!,"Stayed here for 3 nights whilst on a city tour of Singapore before flying out to Bali. The hotel was nice, clean and in a convenient location, right next to Outram Park MRT which goes to most locations and just up the the road from China town. The breakfast was good, although slightly limited options, the bed was comfortable and we had a spacious, clean bathroom/shower. We very much used this hotel as ‘bed and breakfast’ as we were out all day and evening on all three days. The hotel doesn’t offer room service which was a little disappointing seeing as we arrived at 11.00pm and needed food. We had to resort to downloading the grab app and finding a fast food takeaway that delivers to get us through the night.

For a 4 star property the breakfast choices were minimal, the scrambled eggs, which was more like a soup and the under cooked bacon were very marginal in trusting proper preparation, but the undercooking was made up by the over cooked fried eggs.

Pool experience was good, pool water was not cold, a little warm, which is great. But swimming at night may be too dim and dark. Located just a stone throw from Outram Park MRT Station. There's no shopping mall or convenience shop nearby, so during my stay i would just take 1 station down to Chinatown to shop and buy food. However, we had a really bad experience during our 3D2N stay. On the 2nd day, we allowed the Housekeeping attendant to make up the room while we were out. We returned in the afternoon. In the evening when we were about to go for a swim, I realised that my daughter's swimming vest went missing. I searched high and low for it, but couldn't find it.

I told the officers at the front desk, let them take photo of the remaining earrings, and asked them to recheck for me before leaving. In the evening, Mr. Oonah Taylor together with security officer (s) were the ones who could find and returned it to me in original condition. I didn't see her on check-out date; anyway, would like to thank her and the team very much for the adorable patience, great kindness, and impressive service",5 out of 5,January 2020,4.0 of 5 stars,#103 of 374 hotels in Singapore,0.30653846153846154,0.5345299145299145,65.32692307692307,53.45299145299145,30.653846153846153,Services
Dorsett Singapore,Not 4 star!,Stayed here for 3 nights with my husband while exploring the city. This hotel is no way a 4 star. The reception looks like it is while the rooms tell a very different story. They are old and dated with a musty smell. More like a cheap 3 star. Also had a bad experience with a dirty towel being left in our room with a dirty plaster on it. When we went down to tell reception and ask them for new towels they didn’t seem bothered at all and got no apology. When we returned we had new towels but they hadn’t taken the dirty ones away. Customer service at reception wasn’t great. There was a lovely lady who served the breakfast who was very friendly and always offered advice on things to do and see. Have to say the only plus for this hotel is the location but we wouldn’t stay again.,3 out of 5,January 2020,4.0 of 5 stars,#103 of 374 hotels in Singapore,0.025291982323232348,0.5996654040404039,51.26459911616161,59.966540404040394,2.529198232323235,General

No outlet for the hair dryer in the bathroom so have to sit on the bed and use a mirror kind of far away. Shower door skims the floor so tightly that it bunches up the bathmat and you have to step out onto a bare floor, which could be slippery and dangerous. Also, every day at least one of my towels was threadbare or had a hole in it. That being said, I would definitely return to the Dorsett due to location adn friendly staff.",4 out of 5,October 2019,4.0 of 5 stars,#103 of 374 hotels in Singapore,0.004404761904761903,0.4255357142857143,50.22023809523809,42.55357142857143,0.44047619047619024,Cleaniness

Thanks to the crew for giving room at 9am itself. Total relief. Couldn't get this in the previous visit though. Rooms are decent enough for staying with all the regular amenities provided like toilitries, pool and gym. I would say the breakfast is average rather good. May be because of less vegetarian/indian options for me. Singapore is not aplve where we stay inside the rooms and all we need is a comfortable sound sleep at the end of exhaustive walk or trips/visits of city.

Dorsett Singapore,Highly Satisfactory,"If the area is where you want to stay, this is the hotel. It is in the Chinatown area, right on top of a subway station, where I enjoyed the night life of Chinatown and the convenient of access practically everywhere by MRT. I stayed only one night this trip to embark a cruise at Harbor Front and the location is just right. Very well-managed chain (from Hong Kong) and the room allocated to me is spacious and has excellent city view. It has all facilities including a mobile phone for local use. Service is very good.

Dorsett Singapore,"Mouldy ceiling, small room, good location","The Dorsett Singapore fell well short of my expectations. Firstly, the ceiling of my room was severely mouldy - see attached photo, which for me it unacceptable for a 4 star hotel. The lobby I also found uncomfortably hot, almost like they do not have the air conditioning running, and I live in Dubai so am used to hot and humid conditions. The double single bed room was small and tight with very little space to move around. On the plus sides, the beds are comfortable, and the location is on the edge of Chinatown, meaning that you have more eating and drinking options on your doorstep than you could wish for.

Dorsett Singapore,Really excellent hotel,Staying at the Dorsett was a wonderful experience. The location was fantastic - right next to the Outram Park MRT with a lift from the MRT to just opposite the hotel and only requiring traversing four stairs and one quiet lane. The Dorsett is walking distance to China Town and Pinnacle@Dutton and in a very lovely area. We used it as a base to explore as far as Tanah Merah to the east and Tuas in the West. The hotel itself had a pretty classy lobby. When arriving desk staff were kind and helpful and there was self-serve calamasi drinks available near the entry. On our last day we inquired about a late check-out and got a one-hour extension (it was all we needed) at no cost and they set up the room keys immediately to confirm this and they were so nice about it.

The positives are the location which is excellent, near enough to thw hustle and bustle of Chinatown but far enough away from the noise. Also service is generally very good.

After check out, we could also leave our luggage and hotel staff coordinated showering facilities. The room we had was a corner one so we had a nice view of the city.

Dorsett Singapore,The best staff in the world!,"I stayed at the Dorsett for 3 nights in early July, business trip. The hotel is fine for the price bracket - the pool is very nice, although there could be a few more amenities and protection from the view and noise of traffic; the restaurant to be avoided. The hotel is on the edge of Chinatown - not the sterile Singapore I had expected, but rather a messy, vibrant and trendy network of streets and alleyways, with some delicious food. But the best thing by far was the hotel staff, who are the friendliest and most helpful I have ever come across. On arrival, I was allowed to check in and given a room hours before the due time; after a long o/n flight from London that was wonderful. During my stay, I found helpful and friendly advice whenever required.

Dorsett Singapore,Location & Amazing Staff,Arrived after a late night flight and the check-in process was extremely smooth and friendly even for the early hours of the morning. My partner and I were celebrating a special occasion and the staff couldn't have been more friendly and accommodating. The location was perfect for those who don't want the hustle and bustle of Orchard but still want the convenience of easy MRT access to Santosa & Marina Bay. The proximity to local hawkers/ Chinatown made the trip all that more authentic. Working in the Hospitality industry myself & having been to Singapore many times I would have no hesitation recommending Dorsett to my friends and family for their future travel. Please commend the whole team for an overall amazing experience. Looking forward to staying here again. - Yohan,5 out of 5,June 2019,4.0 of 5 stars,#103 of 374 hotels in Singapore,0.3259103641456583,0.4988095238095238,66.29551820728292,49.88095238095238,32.591036414565835,Services

The shower cubicle had mould on rubber sealing and floor tiles, again, I couldn't use the shower bare feet. The toilet paper holder was rusted badly and broken.

The room is small although the room condition is pretty new. However, there’s an issue with the toilet design. This toilet is so poorly designed such that the toilet bowl area is adjacent to the shower area and both areas share 1 door.

In fact, you could not get into the bathroom without walking over the bed and stepping down into it.

Dorsett Singapore,Thumbs Up!,"We booked the Dorsett Room at a reasonable price since it was a mid-week day and was pleasantly surprised to be upgraded to a balcony room. Although the room was small, it was enough space for 2. The location was great because it was easily accessible to Outram MRT, and taxi fare is fairly cheap if you plan to roam the city. The bed was really comfortable but the pillows are too soft for my taste. The pool was nice and not crowded because it’s a weekday, but the view from the pool was a construction (not the hotel’s fault though). We weren’t able to check out the rooftop garden :( The breakfast was not that great, for $23 per person it would be better to walk around i.e. Chinatown for breakfast option.

Dorsett Singapore,Dorsett did NOT disappoint !,"We spent 4 days at the Dorsett, choosing to break away from the chains such as Sofotel, Ibis, Crown but still wanting the Mc-Luxury of knowing what we are getting, you know that no surprises, uninterrupted comfort that comes with a solid hotel brand - where we are paying so we don’t have to think about (or demand) it. Our regular readers know we are well travelled and just as happy sleeping on a beach in Cuba as we are in a 5 star hotel in NYC. We chose Dorsett as we had never stayed at a Chinese hotel chain - how would it stack up? Also we specifically chose for location and that was to be right in the thick of Chinatown.

The tube system was super easy and we used the tube to get from and to the airport - only 1 easy change (platform opposite) and cheap, would recommend doing this. When we arrived we were knackered and the receptionists and bell boy were so kind and welcoming and sorted out an early check in. We didn’t have breakfast as seemed expensive. Late check out kindly arranged for us also. Easy tube journeys to Clarke quay and other places.

Dorsett Singapore,Better for Short Stays,"The Dorsett has a direct connection to Outram Park MRT, which certainly makes it convenient for transport. There is a bus stop just in front of the hotel. The rooms are quite small though not unexpected in Singapore particularly at this price point. I stayed for nearly 2 weeks on a business trip and towards the end I was beginning to feel cramped in that space. I was quite disappointed with the WiFi as I had high expectations given Singapore's well connected reputation. The 4G connection from the Handyphone provided was much faster. The breakfast spread did not vary much over the course of my stay so towards the end I explored options outside. Since Chinatown is a short walk away, then it was not a problem.

Dorsett Singapore,A very pleasant return,"I last stayed at the Dorsett a year or so ago and was not much impressed. HOWEVER, things have turned around amazingly. I was most impressed on this visit. I returned for the convenience of access not for memories. I do not know how the change came about. I only know that I found the hotel on this occasion delightful. The most startling change to me was the competence, friendliness and helpfulness of the desk staff. Very impressive - and particularly Reuben who was a mine of information and helpfulness, none of which was too much trouble for him. Congratulations. The room I occupied, 330, was excellent.

The hote's 4 star rating is a joke, and an insult to Singapore's hospitality industry.

The mini bar was inadequately stocked (2 soft drinks and 3 beers), there was no room service after 8:30 pm, the breakfast was pretty ordinary, half the lobby was a 'left luggage' faculty, vending machines in the lobby, - DEFINITELY NOT a 'luxurious' experience.

This floor also smelled like mold and you could smell it as soon as you stepped out of the elevator. On the day we left we requested a late check out, the front desk said they would call me back.

The staff were lovely and the bellhop (?) was extremely helpful. Rooms were very nice except for the bathroom! The layout was a bit weird with this sliding door that didn't close off all the way so privacy was a big issue for me. The toilet seat seemed too small for the porcelain and moved a lot so we were a bit apprehensive sitting on it - waiting for the pinch! Also there were black hairs and fluff (?) along the wall in the toilet and there was mould in the shower. Beds were comfy which was great.

It’s also walkable distance to Chinatown. Lobby is quite cosy and room generally clean. However the room quite small and the design of toilet is like some reviewer mentioned before, it’s quite strange. The mirror of toilet is on the door of the wardrobe and the door of the wardrobe is a part of the wall of the toilet. Which if we slide the door and close the wardrobe, there’s no mirror in the toilet. The toilet is not a totally enclosed space.

Dorsett Singapore,Was only just OK,"We stayed here in April and June 2017 as a stop over on our trip to Europe. The hotel presents very well on the internet, but when you get there it's not quite as advertised. The hotel is relatively small with small rooms to match.

There are no shade areas and limited sun loungers. There is a construction site next door and the noise was unbelievable. The MRT is underneath, which was great and there were a few decent places to go to eat around the hotel. We found the location only convenient for the MRT.

Singapore does have space issues. I tend to judge rooms based on cleanliness, bed comfort and bathrooms. The room was clean. There were though some old spillage stains on the carpet. The room had complimentary water and tea and coffee making facilities. There was only powdered milk and this curdled one time. The beds were very comfortable and the air con kept the room cool. Maybe a bit too cool. Even after adjusting the room was quite cold during the night. Better than too warm though. The bathroom was a good size and had a shower.

Dorsett Singapore,Friendly staff. Nice experience.,"Stayed at Dorset hotel last Thursday for staycation. Was welcomed by friendly front desk rep. (Its a pity that I didn't get her name) Check in was quick n prompt. Was allocated a room at the 10th floor. Wasn't able to find my room number and was assisted by one of the housekeepers. Room cleanliness was there. Varieties of TV channel so you won't get bored at night. Amenities provided. Location at Chinatown where there are many eateries nearby. Downside: We have made the booking thru expedia and apparently, you can get to enjoy breakfast at half price. (Usual price is $32) We opted for the offer and paid for $16. We were relieved that we paid for half price for the breakfast as its not worth paying 32 bucks for the limited selection.

On top of this, one of them in room 1009 was spoiled and I can only use one side at any one time. Overall, not too bad experience, will come back if there are promotions.

The booked through my company booking tool and they kind of rate doesn't appear on the system. They just wanted the cash in. Not good. It smacks of sharp practice.

The deluxe room has more space which made quite a difference. There was a welcoming letter from management a fruit selection. I think I prefer the bathroom layout in the Dorsett room. It allows more space for personal things and also has more separation between the room and bathroom which enhances privacy.

Dorsett Singapore,Good location MRT and Chinatown,Walking distance to Chinatown and MRT. The location was so suitable and having a MRT station across the road was the biggest advantage. Not only it saved me lots of transport money but it also gave me access to many places in Singapore. A side note - be prepared to walk lots and have a drinking bottle of water with you. The room which I got was away from the lift and on a higher floor. Both of these were a big plus. The bed was a two single bed placed side by side and became a double bed. The middle of the bed could be felt if one spread across. The bathroom was small and had no privacy if you were sharing the room with a friend or friends. Housekeeping was excellent.

The phone also allowed for wifi on the go so we could update our social media and check emails away from the hotel.",4 out of 5,November 2016,4.0 of 5 stars,#103 of 374 hotels in Singapore,0.18883597883597886,0.4876322751322751,59.44179894179894,48.763227513227505,18.883597883597886,Amenities
Dorsett Singapore,Smart hotel. Great location,"Good, comfortable hotel with brilliant proximity to chinatown, Duxton, Tanjong Pagar roads etc. Great if you want to be nearby some cool bars, cafes and restaurants. My room was on the small side but loved the rain shower. The pool area is satisfactory, although faces onto busy, New Bridge road and there is also a large, quite noisy construction site going on right opposite. Great for a dip though if you just want to cool off. There was no noise from construction in my room at all however. Only on the pool deck. My tip: don't do breakfast at the hotel, though I'm sure it's fine. Instead, turn right out the front door of the hotel and walk up the hill a couple of hundred metres or so until you meet the cross street. There you'll find a great (western) cafe/breakfast option",4 out of 5,October 2016,4.0 of 5 stars,#103 of 374 hotels in Singapore,0.3566068851783137,0.5615921115921116,67.83034425891569,56.15921115921117,35.66068851783137,Amenities

The shower temperature fluctuates between hot and cold so I could not enjoy my hot showers after a long day at work. One disappointing experience - I was in a hurry the morning I was checking out and accidentally left my expensive toiletries in the shower. When I called back that night to get them returned to me, the hotel staff said housekeeping had not found my items. Someone is clearly not being honest because I knew exactly where I had left my things and it was not found? I am glad it was not something more valuable or sentimental as I would be very upset about not getting it back.",3 out of 5,September 2016,4.0 of 5 stars,#103 of 374 hotels in Singapore,0.07954545454545454,0.5356060606060606,53.97727272727273,53.56060606060606,7.954545454545454,Cleaniness

Located near the Chinatown area and right atop Outram Park MRT station, the hotel lobby is outfitted with an ensemble of carefully curated chandelier designs which illuminates the immediate reception area in a sensually warm fashion; this is neatly complemented by a cast of polite staff, ranging from the meticulous porter (whom we encountered on the way in and was ushering a Thai couple to a hailed taxi before wishing them godspeed with a humble traditional bow) to the attentive, cheery staff ( special shout-out to a Miss Angelia who served us with great care during both checking in and out).

For example, I saw a lot of dust collected on top of the toilet paper roll holder, and one of the spoons was dirty.

Dorsett Singapore,A proper business Hotel,"I stayed here for almost 10 days in December 2015. This place is the perfect business hotel, with a very courteous and helpful staff everywhere and that no nonsense business demeanour which is not in your face but at the same time is highly attentive. The rooms are spacious and comfortable and quiet, though I was a bit unnerved by the separation between the basin area and the room itself. Probably works for times when you really cant miss that show on the TV, but otherwise can really throw you off guard. But, I guess I'm just being picky about a really comfortable room. The breakfast spread was big and you can get spoilt for choice, especially with the baked section. But being there for 10 days, I pretty much could predict the spread every morning.

Dorsett Singapore,"Decent hotel, convenient location","This hotel is close to our offices, but may not be convenient to all. Perfect as a work hotel, rooms not massive, but perfectly good enough, decent pool, somewhat random empty roof terrace (without a bar). Helpfully they supply a mobile phone with free 4G mobile access (and tethering) and free calls to some countries. Only downside was the restaurant, I'd definitely skip breakfast and go to one of the local places, we really liked Luxe which does a decent Aussie breakfast",4 out of 5,April 2016,4.0 of 5 stars,#103 of 374 hotels in Singapore,0.20238095238095236,0.6666666666666666,60.11904761904761,66.66666666666666,20.238095238095237,General
Dorsett Singapore,Super convenient location for leisure travellers,"Stayed there for 4 nights with my partner.

It's directly connected to Outram Park MRT station, great access to Marina Bay, China Town, Sentosa & more must-visit places!

The room is small but manageable considering I am only here to sleep. The bathroom also super small , one of those with little shelf space to put your toiletries or to hang clothes. The cleanliness is very avenger considering this is Singapore. The breakfast also average but sufficient basic food types . If you arrive after 10am there isn't much left to eat.

Dorsett Singapore,Satisfactory stay but will not book again,"The Front Office and Pappasan staff were great. The location of the hotel is strategically located due to 3 MRT lines traversing Outram Park station. You have to go out of the hotel, walk 2 mins to reach the lift leading to the MRT station. The only thing is, there was no bell service to help us with our 3 trolley luggages when we checked in. I also asked if we can avail of the free handyphone but I was told I am not eligible because I got a twin room. I was surprised because in their website, it said all rooms and we stayed on a weekend. Maybe it's because I booked through Agoda and not directly at the hotel.

Dorsett Singapore,Could do better,"There is a huge construction site across the street which dominates the feel of the hotel since it faces it. The pool looks over the construction and is far too low being only on the 2nd floor (European/3rd Floor Singaporean). The pool area is not someplace that I would like to spend time. It is just off a busy street and the huge construction site. I found the room design to be bizarre. I got a loft room. The bed upstairs literally just fit within the glass box containing the bed. I was travelling alone so this was not such a problem, but there is absolutely no way to have a second person climb out of bed without going over the other sleeper.

Dorsett Singapore,Not a present experience with a small local brand,"Not my usual choice of hotel brands, but I gave it a go anyway. So, I got myself an executive double room with bath tub and walk-in rain shower for 4 nights. On the 1st night they put me into a room with barely wifi coverage and they suggested a change of room. However on the 2nd night in the replacement room there was no water stopper for the bath tub, so I called the front desk and they send a technician up to check it out. He took off after a glimpse, he didn't return after 45 mins so I called the front desk again to check on the status. After 5 mins or so, the technician came back with the manager saying 'they don't have a replacement stopper to spare' and suggested a change of room again the next day, meanwhile they will use duct tape for a bush fix.

Only after intervention with the great help of booking.com I managed to get a solution. Suddenly the extra bed was possible. Be carefull when booking this hotel online !

Dorsett Singapore is very accessible from the Changi Airport. You can either pick a taxi or take the train; either way, it's very convenient. Initially, you would be mesmerized by the glitter of the hotel's lobby and facade. It's very well - designed and well - maintained. The friendly staff welcoming you from the front door and accommodates you fully that ranges from your inquiries before going to the hotel until you check - out.

Dorsett Singapore,Fuss free stay & very good value.,"We like this hotel because 1. It has direct access to the mrt station. ( Outram park , north east line) The covered access to the mrt exit meant you won't get wet esp in tropical Spore. If you are exiting the station look for exit h. There is a dedicated lift up to street level where hotel is. 2. Clean rooms, well designed to make use of the compact space. Honestly it was quite spacious considering how expensive Spore is. We had a king bed which was great for 2 adults & a young child. Bathroom was pretty big. Aircond temperature was easily adjustable. Modern, clean lines. 3.

HOWEVER why is there always a however with hotels. I had prepaid for the night including breakfast. I was asked for a security deposit and being 1 am in the monenig i was not thinking clearly. The hotel wanted to swipe my card - I always use a debit card and normally refuse to pay any security deposit as the hotels are fully paid BEFORE you arrive - its insulting and suggests that all travellers will do something to the hotel. I to speed things up offered my debit card and advised the staff that is was a debit card. The card as DEDUCTED and not like a credit card takes about 7 days to come back.

Dorsett Singapore,A relaxing great staycation!,"Dorsett Singapore is a 4 star hotel conveniently located at the corner of the road junction between New Bridge Road and Cantonment Road. It is also situated right beside Outram Park MRT. The hotel exudes an artistic atmosphere and is well maintained. The hotel rates are very reasonable considering how comfortable and nice the hotel rooms are. We booked the Splash Room even though it’s a tad expensive compared to the other rooms because I felt that the difference in price is worth it for the bathtub. The bed was pretty comfortable too! Overall, the staycation experience at Dorsett was nice as we felt that the hotel is stylish, modern and clean. Its strategic location beside Outram Park MRT is another plus point and the price of a night’s stay is also reasonable.

Dorsett Singapore,They try hard but still do not get it right,"Dorsett seemed to be a perfect fit: New, close to China Town and in walking distance to the MRT. The international staff seems nice on the first sight but if any problems occur they lose the professionall facade. This happened when I complained about the obviouse smoking smell (in a non smoking hotel) in the room they gave me during check in. Ok, they booked me into another room. So far so good. The bed sheets however had black/brownish stripes. Slowly they send someone to replace the sheets. There were several tourist groups staying on my floor.

Bed and shower were a bit short for my height, but it didn't disturb me really. Only thing I was not pleased was the noise made by other hotel customers.

The room was very spacious for the two of us and our huge luggages, and the bed was super comfy. We love the fast free WiFi. The most important thing was the customer service.

Dorsett Singapore,Slightly over rated 4 star,Visited during the F1 period so cannot comment on value for money as rates are high as expected. Location: slightly off the main China town line. It is about a 10 minute walk to both China town area or Duxton hill. Don't expect to find the bustle of Singapore like Orchard street or Bencaloon or Clark Quay at your door step. Has a couple of MRT stations nearby but not much else walking distance. Rooms: relatively modern but small and the bathroom very poorly designed and cramped. I personally hate a WC sandwiched between a sink and a wall and a slightly bigger person would have had a hard time using it. Amenities in room very basic but above average wifi. Overall functional and more business driven where one just uses the room fir a nights sleep.

Dorsett Singapore,Lacked the Wow factor but OK,"Stayed with my adult daughter and had booked and re confirmed and prepaid for a twin bedded room. When we checked in they tried to put us in a double room and said they would put an extra bed in the room. The room was tiny, so we refused the room and eventually were allocated a room in the category that we requested. The room was adequate, pretty uninspiring view (police centre) and a strange bathroom that did not offer much privacy. The room was set up for one person, one robe, one pool towel, one pair of slippers, etc. we appreciated the complimentary water.

Dorsett Singapore,All that glitters..,"I really wanted to like this Hotel, and from first appearances its stunning. The designers did an amazing job, unfortunately there are just too many little problems. It shouldn't take 15 minutes waiting at reception to find out what the breakfast costs are for a four year old. After reserving, and paying extra for, an extra bed, being told that a fold away will not fit in your room is ridiculous. After receiving 'an upgrade' we have a soiled fold out lounge, which when folded out has the mattress on the floor and makes it necessary to walk over the mattress to get to the bathroom!! And if paying extra for another bed it would be great if I didn't have to call down at 9pm for sheets/towels.

The next morning I was moved to a third room which was lovely. *I'm sparing you the photos I took of the bits of lint, hair, and what appeared to be a small piece of glass on the carpet.

First stay was in the Splash Room & second visit with my family we booked the Dorsett Rooms. Both room types have pretty much the same deco. Difference is that the Splash Room had a slightly bigger room space and bathtub in the bathroom. Nevertheless, both rooms were clean and cozy with comfortable beds, definitely value for money! As for the breakfast selection, there was not much of a spread and it was not great but the friendly service made up for it.

Dorsett Singapore,A Comfortable Business Stay,"Stayed for 4 days and enjoyed my time in the hotel. Staff are friendly and efficient and you're always greeted with a smile whenever you walk through the lobby or past reception. Check in and check-out was fast and efficient - an absolute pleasure. Every morning leaving for work the staff happily go down onto the main road to hail you a cab and of course - service with a smile. Rooms are adequate in size and are pretty well appointed. Bedding nice and crisp and clean and clean towels provided daily. The may want to do an ""audit"" on their cleaning staff though - for the 4 days I was there, there were a couple of long black hairs on my bathroom floor that were never removed - shows a lack of thoroughness in cleaning (my hair is all grey so definitely not me).

We made a request for late check-out that was promptly attended to, the rooms are clean and well sanitised.

Dorsett Singapore,Run-of-the-mill,"Hotel was faultless on cleanliness and comfort, but I'm going to ramble on about their restaurant here since they don't have their own page. The breakfast was a waste of calories! Even though the room came with breakfast for our stay, we decided to go to the nearby cafes instead for our breakfast the rest of the week. It just didn't make sense to come to Singapore, a food paradise, and wind up eating soul-less hotel food. Strike one. We were stranded by the rain, and came back again for lunch, thinking that local dishes might be their specialty even if breakfast isn't, and I had the signature local Chicken Rice. The chicken tasted seriously foul and like it was blood-soaked while being poached. My husband and I both took a bite and pretty much spat it out. Strike two.

Dorsett Singapore,Perfect location for a holiday in Singapore,"It was my first time travelling to Singapore and Dorsett Hotel has been the perfect choice. I have done some research few months ago to find an affordable but great accommodation.

Although the hotel room was palatial, it had everything I needed - wifi, decent/clean bathroom/toilets, pool and a gym. I have to admit, the gym was tiny but it did the job for me.

Large space under entry door allowed noise and light to enter room from corridor = unacceptable.

Dorsett Singapore,Well located new hotel,Dorsett singapore is a nice new hotel with an mrt station ( outran park ) right under it so it's very convenient . It's also within china town so a lot of shopping and food areas around . Cheap souvenir shops and hawkers both for locals and tourists . Good to note that the price in food outlets in the local market is 40% cheaper than the more touristy stalls . The hotel rooms are well appointed . A little small but still comfortable . Breakfast is not very interesting so I don't think I'll get breakfast next time . There are other more interesting options within 5 minutes walk outside at 1/4 the price . There's a well rated fine dining resto just behind : Andre so if you are up for a nice meal it's a good place to try .

However, the room condition was totally not what my friend and I expected. The room was so so dusty especially the cable of the iPod dock and there are even hair strands on the table which is totally not acceptable. Dust can be seen when we tried to flip the mini-bar menu/hotel guide. Bed sheet has a hole as big as 20cents and rain shower was not functioning well despite being a pretty new hotel.

No shortage of sights nearby or fantastic places to eat at a reasonable price. The room itself was spacious enough for a single traveler and the bathroom was good. My card didn't work to access the swimming pool at first but the duty manager couldn't have been quicker to respond to this. Pool is a nice feature too but it's not the largest.

Dorsett Singapore,Nice hotel near Chinatown,"Spent 4 nights with friends at the Dorsett in December 2014. We had three standard rooms all up. The rooms were on the small side but were clean and the beds comfortable. There was only one suitcase stand, so finding room for another large case was awkward. The only real complaint was that there was no drawers anywhere (well we never found any?), so no place to unpack the shorts and socks etc. The hotel overall was a very pleasant experience, with very friendly staff everywhere from the counter staff to the cleaning lady. We also found the young doorman (I can't remember his name ... but I think he said he was only 16) the most helpful. He would arrange for taxi or help with luggage and nothing was too much trouble ... a real asset.

Dorsett Singapore,"Overall, a nice stay","We just completed a nice stay at the Dorsett. We booked it through our Diamond Resorts membership and the room charges were covered without issue. We were happy to find that we were upgraded to a Deluxe room with a king room which I can see from the photos posted is an improvement in size over the standard room. We found the size just fine but the bathroom is cramped with an awkward layout and has a sliding door adjacent to the bed, so privacy is limited. The carpet was VERY dirty but the rest of the room was clean on arrival and the view out the front was nice with large windows. One important update on instructions to arrive via MRT from the Airport.

Dorsett Singapore,Excellent location!,"The hotel is in a great location above the Outram Park MRT. It is only 1 stop from HarbourFront/VivoCity so it’s easy to get to Sentosa Island and 1 stop from Chinatown and a few stops from Orchard Rd, Town Hall, and Marina Bay. There are many places to eat and drink just outside and it’s only a 10 minute walk to Chinatown and hawker centers. The rooms are nice and generally well maintained. We had a room on the 9th floor with views of the CBD. The staff are friendly and helpful. The beds and pillows were comfy and the room was quiet. Free wifi is also a bonus.

Other than that, i have no other complaints.",4 out of 5,November 2014,4.0 of 5 stars,#103 of 374 hotels in Singapore,-0.020833333333333336,0.5134615384615385,48.95833333333333,51.346153846153854,2.0833333333333335,Services
Dorsett Singapore,Great location,"great location near to the Outram Park station and Chintown. Room was clean but very minimal storage options, and the small bathroom takes a wee while to get used to. Had a delay with our check in but overall 4 stars.",4 out of 5,October 2014,4.0 of 5 stars,#103 of 374 hotels in Singapore,0.14777777777777779,0.505,57.388888888888886,50.5,14.777777777777779,Value
Dorsett Singapore,Great location,"Spent 5 nights here this week. Rooms are well equiped with all the essentials, comfy bed and pillows, great air con. Great location next to Outram Park Mrt, which we used to go everywhere even to and from airport. Had breakfast only one morning $98 Sgd for 3 adults inc tax bit on pricey side and nothing really out of the box same as you get in any hotel in asia. Staff are very polite. All in all a good stay.",4 out of 5,November 2014,4.0 of 5 stars,#103 of 374 hotels in Singapore,0.28888888888888886,0.42500000000000004,64.44444444444444,42.50000000000001,28.888888888888886,Value
Dorsett Singapore,Good Location,"The room is clean and cosy. You can sleep well because it is not noisy. If you need bathtub, maybe this is not for you... You can walk to China town! It takes about 5 minutes. Hotel staff are nice.

Dorsett Singapore,"Dorsett hotel, pity about the breakfast........","This is a fairly recently built hotel situated in New Bridge road in Singapore. As we required a hotel stop over our travel agent built this hotel into our itinery along with another party of likewise tourists. The hotel was clean, rooms adequate without being overly large, king size beds and the usual tv and kettle etc, walk-in wet shower room. It has to be said that the hotel decor was a very quirky / strange mixture of modern art and sparkling bling with Asian culture ? The entrance and reception areas are plagued by a mechanically operated grand piano which drove us mad . The breakfast is the worst ever continental breakfast spread that we've encountered, a disgrace. No replacement food put out after the early birds had emptied what was there , complained but got nowhare",4 out of 5,October 2014,4.0 of 5 stars,#103 of 374 hotels in Singapore,-0.02964691558441558,0.48540313852813854,48.51765422077922,48.54031385281385,2.964691558441558,Location
Dorsett Singapore,Conveniently Cosy!,"A great practical hotel suitable for business and leisure traveller. The check in process was smooth and the room was really cosy and clean. Bathroom although small has a luxe feel. The Hotel has many stylish features to capture as well. Location next to Outram Mrt station is superbly convenient! Commendable staff Ira at Front desk and Sunthar, bellman for extending a warm hospitality upon arrival.

Dorsett Singapore,The Royal Treatment,"Dorsett is very reasonably priced for its high-end luxury feel. We stayed there for 6 nights and the hotel was absolutely ideal for us. The sparkling swimming pool and jacuzzi, spotless cleanliness and luxury finishings all make this hotel a comfortable stay. As soon as you enter the front door of the hotel you are greeted by a huge sparkling chandelier, a clean and fresh scent and the soft melodic tones of a piano. As you walk past the lobby to access the lifts, you can't help but smile at the coloured Buddha angel sculptures - ones that inspired and fascinated us so much we walked around Chinatown hoping to find one of our own. This hotel knows the importance of the small details and first impressions, and provides everything you need for a relaxing and convenient stay",5 out of 5,October 2014,4.0 of 5 stars,#103 of 374 hotels in Singapore,0.2751282051282052,0.5625641025641025,63.756410256410255,56.25641025641025,27.512820512820518,General
Dorsett Singapore,Quirky hotel in downtown Chinatown,"Modern pop art meets Asian elegance at The Dorsett. Newly renovated, the rooms are small but beautifully appointed with plush king size beds, and city views over the red-tiled roofs of Chinatown. The pool is on the roof, surrounded by tropical plants, and the small gym overlooks the space. The breakfast is western and eastern - congee one side, bacon and eggs the other. Don't bother with the coffee - seek out a western cafe elsewhere. My room was only serviced once in three days - no one could explain why- but towels were brought up promptly when asked. Great location, minutes from all the sights, smells and sound of Chinatown - plus a short walk from the subway system.",4 out of 5,September 2014,4.0 of 5 stars,#103 of 374 hotels in Singapore,0.13548951048951047,0.41381118881118883,56.77447552447552,41.38111888111888,13.548951048951047,Amenities
