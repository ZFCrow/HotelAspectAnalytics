f1 score:
It is the harmonic mean of precision and recall. It balances the trade-off between precision and recall.
It is particularly useful when you want to find an optimal balance between false positives and false negatives.

precision:
measures the accuracy of positive predictions made by a model.
It is the ratio of true positive predictions to all positive predictions (true positives + false positives).
High precision means that the model makes few false positive errors.

recall:
measures the models ability to find all the positive instances in the dataset. 
It is the ratio of true positive predictions to all actual positive instances (true positives + false negatives). 
High recall means the model does not miss many positive instances.

support:
It represents the number of occurrences of each class in the dataset. 
It helps provide context about the distribution of classes.

accuracy score:
It is the ratio of correct predictions to total predictions made.
