YOTEL Singapore,Short stay cation,"Had a solo staycation at Yotel Singapore. Room was really small and but luckily for me, I didn't have a luggage so it wasn't that bad. Bed had an automatic uplift at the back and that was quite nice as I could watch the TV while sitting up straight. Had quite a few nice channels on the TV so I watched a few movies. Bed was also extremely soft, so I could roll around it and enjoy how fluffy it was. Location was excellent, it was just 5 to 10mins from Orchard mrt station. I managed to buy McDonald's and brought it back to my hotel room. Unfortunately, there was no table or chair so I could only eat on the bed. Toilet was very cool and had a nice large window outside.

When I needed a lightning cable and HDMI cable for my ipad, the mission control staff were quick to help (though I must say I was fortunate enough to snag a lightning cable before they were all taken). When I asked to spend my $40 F&B voucher over multiple visits to the restaurant rather than all at once as required, the young man speaking over the line made sure that that could happen since I was staying alone and would find it hard to eat and drink $40 worth of food at one go.

Changed check in time and upon arrival was told not booking not paid and have to step aside and wait longer for them to check and verify.

YOTEL Singapore,Value for money for the location,Real surprise - nicely tucked behind International Building and easily accessible to the rest of Orchard road. Facilities is basic but really adequate for a stay in Orchard - interesting concept of 'Mission Control' for the lobby and each room is like a private airplane bunk (with recline-able bed!) It was a good choice to have a washroom with full floor to ceiling view of the outside - great view of Scott Road and beyond. Otherwise space is limited though not a problem at all for a solo passenger. The next time round would love a room having a view of the Orchard Road side. Food choice seems limited though I do see quite a bit of people dapao-ing. The two robots Yolanda and Yoshi are quite a novelty - will try to call for their service next time.

But if you are coming by public transport (Bus/MRT), you can enter the hotel through INTERNATIONAL BUILDING during the mall's opening hours, or walk around the side of INTERNATIONAL BUILDING. We got the room with the queen bed and upper bunker, so technically the room can accommodate 3 guests. We were supposed to have one more friend, but he had to pull out because he contracted COVID-19.

YOTEL Singapore,Good for a one night solo staycation,"Generally ok, but wouldn't recommend more than a night or two. Size of cabin is great for only a person or maybe 2 people max. Cleanliness of cabin could really be improved as blinds were fairly dirty, and entire cabin was quite dusty (even the bed and pillow!). I don't know if it's just me having sensitive skin but i started itching a few hours into my stay and didn't sleep well as my entire body started itching after going under the blanket during bedtime. It is good that the bed is adjustable to either a sleeping or sitting position but do take note that because of this, the bed has a sunken point (at the point of bending) when bed is in sleeping position. Had a very uncomfortable night sleeping due to this. Aircon also kept adjusting on its own and it got really hot",4 out of 5,March 2022,4.0 of 5 stars,#89 of 372 hotels in Singapore,0.09843749999999998,0.6515624999999999,54.921875,65.15625,9.843749999999998,Cleaniness

YOTEL Singapore,WORST EXPERIENCE,I never recommend this property as a 4 start hotel. The rooms are very small and difficult to accommodate to adults in the room. The wash rooms are also smelly as there was no ventilation provided. You can also hear the sound of other water flows and thereby the feeling you get that you live inside the wash room. The Bed arrangement is terrible as all the beds in the hotel are folding beds. Therefore you cannot have a comfortable sleep. The Breakfast was absolutely disastrous as there was no buffet. Even the alacarte menu has no choice and had to experience the same menu for 6 days.,1 out of 5,April 2022,4.0 of 5 stars,#89 of 372 hotels in Singapore,-0.1904040404040404,0.6133333333333333,40.47979797979798,61.33333333333333,19.04040404040404,Cleaniness
YOTEL Singapore,Staycation at YOTEL,I really like how the hotel looks very futuristic. Cleanliness of the hotel room was what I liked the most. Paid extra for the view and it was worth it. Made a special request for the robot to sing Happy Birthday for my boyfriend and it did happen that was really enjoyable. I love the cabin guide on the television. Really good customer service - they sent a messaging saying that we can check in as early as 7am but due to work we were not able to.

YOTEL Singapore,Worst Hotel Experience in My Life,"You cant have a better location than this as it is just 2 mins walk to orchard road. However, the room was absolutely trash. The room was so dirty that we found cockroach in the room (as shown in the photo, there is a Yotel sticker on the switch to prove this was indeed taken in Yotel). This is also the first hotel I have ever been that does not provide housekeeping service. There is a ""please make up my room"" button but the room was not cleaned throughout our 4D3N stay. Also, the gimmicky bed was a hell for anyone with a spine. The mattress was so soft that when the it was flattened down (there is a switch for you to elevate the head of the bed), it became a C shaped mattress. This was literally worse than lying on the ground, which was not an option due to the limited space",1 out of 5,April 2022,4.0 of 5 stars,#89 of 372 hotels in Singapore,-0.05019841269841271,0.47900793650793655,47.49007936507936,47.90079365079365,5.019841269841271,Cleaniness

Wifi was fast and while there were a lot of rooms, the number of lifts was enough that there was not much waiting to go up or down to the room levels. TV had the usual cable channels covering news and info, movies and entertainment. Now the not so good points: room is small, if you have several pieces of luggage you may have little room to move left. There is no place to sit or work unless you used the luggage rack as a workaround bench. Cleaning is not done daily. We stayed 4 days and the rooms were never cleaned.

Bed is too soft or maybe worn out already. When you lie down the mattress flattens and does not hold shape, so for me who is used to sleeping on a semi firm mattress it was a little uncomfortable.

We only had the breakfast (Buffet) and it was good. Although the buffet was not very big, it had a good set of options. They were good in flavor too. The Hotel promotes itself as a smart hotel, and it has two robot servers to assist guests. They are cool.

YOTEL Singapore,Miserably small room,"The room was so small that it was difficult for two people to maneuver and hard to deal with luggage. Since there was no place to really store anything, we had to live out of our suitcases, but there was really no place to put them. There is only one ""nightstand"" as the sink is on the other side of the bed in the room. And there is one wet area that houses both the toilet and shower. If you check out early, they still charge you for not giving 48 hour notice. Felt like it was more like a hostel than a hotel room.

YOTEL Singapore,Great Hotel,Great hotel and location. We arrived at 4am and check in was very straightforward. Rooms are on the small side but that is to expect for Singapore. Great amenities in the room and the bed even moves. Very close to the train station. The rooms have a bathroom with a clear view of the city which I found great. We didn't eat in the restaurant just because their are so many choices in Singapore but the menu looks great. The train station is extremely close which is beneficial but the train station confusing with numerous entries and exits so bear that in mind.

YOTEL Singapore,Poor value for money,"Stayed in Yotel SG for 1 night on 09 Dec 2022. Great location. Smart use of tech for check in and check out, beating the silly time taken by legacy hotels. Dislikes: - room is way too small for the price point. Hardly any space for luggage - toilet is equally tiny. - hand bidet has no water pressure. Serves no purpose - having wash basin in sleeping area is bad idea - toilet floor is very slippery. Accident waiting to happen - not sure why playing loud disco music outside the hotel. Irritating.

It was impossible to store anything, my clothes and stuff had to be left inside the luggage during my 3 nights stay. The wash basin is right next to the bed which is quite inconvenient. The bed had to be folded during the day, otherwise there's no room to walk pass. For such a tiny little room and the price they charge is astonishing. Way over-priced! -- Perhaps it's because of the location? -- I don't understand how they can claim 4-star for this kind of room. Service is non-existent. Stay here only if you are traveling solo for only 1 night and can't find anywhere else available.

YOTEL Singapore,Not good for me,"This is a hotel with small rooms. The staff is ok, they will help you with your check in and check out but they can do better. On checkout, I tried using the computer and they told me to go to the front desk, upon going there everyone was busy and they kept pointing me to go see the other staff. The room is really small. The Washbasin is beside your bed which really bothers me. The 3rd person should sleep in the bunk bed on top so he/she has to climb a ladder. My nephew who just woke up fell from the ladder as he missed one step. Good thing nothing happened. I won't go back to this hotel, it is not for me. I stayed for 3 nights and am glad to be out.

What's more, and this is the biggest drawback, there's no closet where you can put your clothes, so we had to keep them in our suitcases, bearing in mind that we were",3 out of 5,September 2023,4.0 of 5 stars,#89 of 372 hotels in Singapore,0.18269557823129248,0.561734693877551,59.134778911564624,56.173469387755105,18.269557823129247,General

YOTEL Singapore,Enjoyable First Experience at Yotel,"The location is wonderful! I like the interesting, modern design and the technology embedded in it. At the same time, what I love to be better would be the acceptable breakfast, the initially confusing check-in process and the fun-sounding yet also initially confusing names for reception and housekeeping and the longer than expected time for housekeeping to address my issue after calling them (at least 30mins). They were servicing a fully booked day, so perhaps that is why. To me it doesn't feel as value for money because of the above and considering, at time of booking, other hotels nearby are offering around the same price.
