Grand Copthorne Waterfront,First and last visit....,"First and last visit at Grand Copthorne due to the sounds in the room. The elevators can ve heard in several rooms. This I know since I just changed room and I can still hear the elevators. Although, in my previous room next to the elevator it sounded as if an air plane was gona land as the room even shivered a bit. I changed for another room and I can still hear it and now I also have the guy staying in the room above me blowing his nose several times and I can hear him walking around in his room. Worst sound proofing ever!! Friendly staff and very helpful but will defiantly not stay here again and I don’t know how I will manage the coming 2 nights here.....

Grand Copthorne Waterfront,Only Here for the Club Lounge,"The rooms are very 80s - looked very tired. But it was spacious. The beds were good and provided good sleep. The bathroom was good in a sense that the shower stall was separated from the bathtub. As for toiletries, the room was stocked with the usual shower foam / shampoo / body lotion / dental kits / towels and hair dryer. However, the room was not in the best of state – the tile by the bathtub was falling off, the soundproofing of the room was not good, I was only at level 13 in a building of 30 storeys, the wallpapers were peeling off etc. Grand Copthorne Waterfront Executive Club Lounge: I came for the Club lounge, and it did not disappoint.

Grand Copthorne Waterfront,Wonderful service and exception restaurants!,I stayed at Grand Copthorne Waterfront hotel last year for a short weekend staycation. What's unique about this hotel is simply their service. It was an enjoyable stay as the staff is very accomodating. The hotel breakfast was fantastic too. I miss their local buffets because they serve up really delicious local delights!

Grand Copthorne Waterfront,Amazing Stay,"We had a 3 night stay in this hotel in Sept 2019 and it was amazing!!! We arrive very early in Singapore and although we could not check in, the hotel had a residential lounge located on the 5th floor. Here we were able to have a much needed shower, change and relax after a long flight. The lounge had bottled water and the hotel staff provided us with very much needed extra strong coffee to start our day. The hotel staff were kind enough to book us onto their Tiong Bahru tour on the same morning where we were given $5 each to spend on breakfast in the food hall. This was more than enough for us to buy a full breakfast with coffee and juice. The tour was also filled with lovely snacks and knowledge provided by a local guide.

There were also novel items which were of good quality like the cheesecake dessert.   Our venue was spectacular. The Grand Ballroom decoration was extravagant with fairy lights and street lights.

Grand Copthorne Waterfront,Good one week stay,Stayed at the Grand Copthorne for one week for a meeting. The rooms are nice although slightly dated but a good size. The restaurant was shut down for our meeting solely and given the large quantity of food that was being made to accommodate our meeting it was excellent. I can't comment how it is on a regular day. I used the gym almost daily and it wasn't state of the art but it did the job. I did not use the pool but it looked nice with great views. The hotel staff was friendly and accommodating. Location wise it was pretty good and about a half hour walk to Marina Bay which was nice in our situation to get out after long daily meetings.,4 out of 5,November 2019,5.0 of 5 stars,#82 of 372 hotels in Singapore,0.34212614870509606,0.572511406721933,67.1063074352548,57.2511406721933,Amenities,34.212614870509604

Many hotels would not accept a booking for one night and this hotel was one of the few who did. The room we booked was a King Executive with lounge access. We arrived well before check in due to an early flight and was surprised to see nobody was at the entrance to assist with our luggage. Things improved when the guy on check informed us our room was ready. Again, we had to transport our luggage to the elevator ourselves.

Grand Copthorne Waterfront,Omelette Robot Sabotage!,"My family stayed here for 2 nights to see the city and get over our jet leg before starting on a cruise and I have only positive things to say. The rooms were clean and comfy and the staff helpful and friendly throughout our stay. Pleased to say that the hotel responded very swiftly to a couple of queries I sent via email before our stay too. Very professional. We were easily able to catch buses / taxis to get to various attractions in the city. The best thing about this hotel is the breakfast. Everything was delicious, there was a good range, and the omelette robot really caught the attention of everyone around (including the chef making omelettes manually who we joked may not have been such a fan...).",5 out of 5,January 2020,5.0 of 5 stars,#82 of 372 hotels in Singapore,0.3465959595959596,0.5333636363636364,67.32979797979797,53.336363636363636,Services,34.65959595959596

Grand Copthorne Waterfront,Couple of days after our cruise,The hotel is old. We had 2 rooms . The rooms are not designed with any comfort in mind . There are only 2 charging plug points both of which not not near the bedside nor conveniently located . One charging plug point is at the floor skirting level no where near a bed or the writing table . So to make coffee one has to keep the kettle on the carpet. The in room dining food is very limited and average. If you r a vegetarian and are staying for 3 nights u have to order the same dish every night if u want to eat in ur room. I ordered for fish cakes and what I got was something which I would get in a supermarket . I think they serve frozen supermarket stuff.

The view is spectacular even from a relatively low floor, but it is recommended to book a club room that comes automatically on one of the upper floors. The biggest perk besides the room itself is the club lounge on the 29th floor with the best views imaginable and with free afternoon tea and snacks, and cocktails in the evenings. Also breakfast on the upper floor makes the day start way better. Wafa, Jacob and the rest of the crew in the lounge are always so attentive! All in all a great experience.

On both stays our spacious room had lovely views across the Singapore river. The hotel is very well situated on Robertson Quay with a bridge behind the hotel leading across the river to all the restaurants & cafes on the Quayside.

The room was spacious and very clean, bathroom not so spacious but was equally as clean. Cosy dressing gowns. Very good pool area, gym was small but adequate. It's well-located on the river, not far from Robertsons Quay and Clarke's Quay for drinks and (expensive) food. Nice walk along the river to Marina Bay area (40 mins?).

We had breakfast here on the second morning as we thought it was worth the money with all the different choices. Day before we had breakfast at one of the local cafe's, very nice but if you wanted a few coffees cost mounted up so more economical to have breakfast at hotel especially with the fruit, make your own pancakes, cooked breakfast etc. Rooms were lovely and big. If you walk along the canal area you will end up in the harbour area, takes 20-30 minutes. Lots to look at on the way.

Grand Copthorne Waterfront,Hosted our wedding,"We were very pleased with how our wedding banquet went. From the very first day of meeting up with the hotel manager Serene, the guidance and assurance allowed us to have a fuss free preparation. We are very impressed by the professionalism of the Banquet Manager & other staffs. We have feedbacks from few of our relatives & friends that the food is great and that we made a good choice in the selection of holding our banquet in Grand Copthrone.

Grand Copthorne Waterfront,Wonderful experience with an amazing buffet!,"From the moment of entering, made to feel welcome. Enjoyed the stay. Highlights were the excellent staff, the beautiful walks riverside all the way to Clark Quay, and of course the buffet! What can i say about this buffet except that it is an amazing must try. We really enjoyed Food Capital. The choice of foods and quality was immense. Its probably one of the most under-rated buffets in Singapore.

Grand Copthorne Waterfront,Review of,The hotel really nice and good. Apart from the fact it lives up to its expectations in the reviews i read. The hotel staff are very nice and kind. My experience with them has been the best. As I don't normally eat the hotel food but and I was in quarantine so I couldn't go out to get food and I had nobody to order for me. They went out of their way and bought food for me with their Own money which is one of the most generous and kind thing to do. I would like to express my gratitude to them. The service is also good. The view from the room is amazing and the beds are very comfortable. Overall it is one of the best hotels I've been to because of all the kindness the hotel staff have showed me and the good service,5 out of 5,September 2021,5.0 of 5 stars,#82 of 372 hotels in Singapore,0.6033333333333333,0.6833333333333333,80.16666666666666,68.33333333333333,Services,60.33333333333333

And for this Hotel to be 5-star is an absolute joke -- they should be downgraded immediately until they finally refurbish and improve their service standards. Other hotels have fared way better facing the same issues brought by this pandemic, so there's no excuse for this Hotel to fail so terribly like this: 1. The Hotel ignored my simple room request (high-floor, river view) without providing a valid explanation or even a reasonable solution. Not only that, the check-in staff even 'fluffed' me by saying my room (11th floor) is already 'high'. Context: The Hotel has guestrooms from 7-28th floor.

Good scenes for a morning jog if you are looking for some fresh air outdoor.

There were quite a few faulty items in either rooms - thermostat not working/ spoilt bathroom fixtures. Overall bed quality and standard of housekeeping were good.

The pool was really enjoyable with deck chairs which was a nice way to cool off after being out all day in the the heat of the city! For Singapore standards the room was very spacious and the bathroom was so impressive with a lovely powerful shower and a large bath. The rooms have big floor to ceiling windows providing a great view to the city. The location was excellent, you can easily walk from the hotel to Clarke Quay by simply following the river. The breakfast was a little disappointing with limited options although this may be because of Covid. Just across the river there is a great choice of restaurants and bars.

Kudos to Danny & Shirley for making us felt at home with excellent service and serving us with varieties of alcoholic/non-alcoholic cocktails and juices. Also made it a point to explain the food served (cold dish, hot dish, and dessert). Pity that the Club Lounge is only open from the afternoon, as the breakfast at level one was heavily packed and the staff there were simply overwhelmed, with exhausted and disgruntled expression. Hence we only had bfast there once, the following day we had ours at Great World City instead, which is just a 8min walk from the hotel.

Megan, let us try the blended drinks, shirley ginger and sea breeze for our final night. She’s very accommodating, they all are. Thirdly, the breakfast buffet is awesome. The pool is great. They’d consider those who are 5ft below in height! Lol! I just found the toilet kinda weird cos no bidet.

Grand Copthorne Waterfront,Zero customer satisfaction,"We stayed at Grand Copthrone Waterfront for 5 nights in the Deluxe Waterfront Room. The view from room was amazing overlooking the river and partial view of Marina Bay Sands. The disappointing things were :- Front Desk staff not at all friendly and never ever even tried to understand our request. It was my son's birthday so when we checked in at that time too I had informed the hotel about the same. Later just one day before too I approached the front desk and requested them to arrange some ballons and a cake for celebrating his birthday (important thing is I told them to charge for all this not do it for free), still nothing was done when we returned to the hotel.

Being put in an old deluxe king room was disappointing to say the least, old carpets and skirting boards that haven't been cleaned for many years were spotted straight away, with the all black marble shower and finding the black door stop on the shower floor was dangerous. Another room was asked for and it was a newer room, cleaner and simply had been re-painted, new carpet and wall decorations. So much better.The hotel itself has great breakfast suiting all nationalities, clean foya area and sits",4 out of 5,July 2022,5.0 of 5 stars,#82 of 372 hotels in Singapore,0.160638998682477,0.5664502164502165,58.03194993412385,56.64502164502166,Value,16.0638998682477

The airconditioner rattled (mentioned but not actioned) and the shower leaked all over the bathroom floor (again mentioned with a fix applied that did not resolve the problem). The pool is fantastic along with the gym. Breakfast is a crowded affair but with quite a range of food items.

For both staycations, I was wowed by the service of the staff at both the reception, as well as in the restaurant. Tip: As the housekeeping staff are mainly migrant workers, it would help them to understand your needs better if you are able to speak their native language instead of English. However, they are very courteous and willing to help. Room wise - decent size but decor is dated. As this property is pretty old, do expect some signs of aging in the room facilities.

Welcome - None Wifi- Free & works well Parking - Self Parking Rooms - We stayed in their premier room +300sqft. The room offers decent view of the city and the river. The beds were comfy. The decor was from the 90s. Not 5 star standard. Needs renovation for sure. Housekeeping- Was hit and miss. Sometimes the room was done well Sometimes they forgot things. Service - The service desk received our call most of the times and requests were fulfilled. Breakfast - The breakfast was decent. The place is kind of small compared to the no. Of guest.

The first time Ive received anything like this from all of my travels. The rooms were a bit disappointing. Old carpet - the type you dont want to walk on with wet feet.... deliberately darker colored. The shower was pretty bad... looked like it hasnt been upgraded since the 90's.

A very comfortable bed however. Staff were relatively pleasant however considering we had mentioned it was our honeymoon there were no ‘special treatment’ services given not even a simple towel decoration. This was the first stop of our multi destination and Copthorne were the only hotel who I would say didn’t make us feel special or even congratulate us on our newlywed status.

We are very grateful because our 3 year old enjoyed the whole staycation experience which includes the club lounge, swim and breakfast buffet. As this was the same hotel which we held our wedding lunch 16 years ago, this stay was even more meaningful for me and my wife.

Grand Copthorne Waterfront,"Best hotel in Singapore, by far!","First and foremost, a special thanks to Navin Seh for providing excellent service throughout our stay. Nonetheless, the hotel's customer service is excellent and friendly, and they quickly resolve any issues that arise. So don't be concerned if you encounter any difficulties during your stay! Simply notify them, and they will take care of the problem. Second, the location is ideal and convenient, as there is an MRT station directly across the street from the hotel. All it takes is a 5-minute morning walk to start your adventure in Singapore! Third, the gym is well-ventilated and clean! The best part is that all of the machines and equipment are working properly. Aside from that, the gym is open 24 hours a day!

Grand Copthorne Waterfront,Grand Copthorne Waterfront is a must. 3rd time here & would come back here again.,Cons- Room seemed smaller than what we’ve had before & it was supposed to be a deluxe room. Mattress so hard have had a sore back all of the holiday. No more excursions can be books here or the little courtesy bus that took you to other malls. That’s a shame. If you like your tea & coffee you only get 2 sachets of coffee & 1 teabag of English tea & 1 uji sencha tea. We went & bought teabags from the supermarket at World City mall. Pros- The room was very clean & you get water bottles everyday. My advice is you get 2 cards so keep a card in the slot at the door to keep the fridge & aircon on. So nice to come back to a cold room. VINCENT is the man you would meet first as he is basically the meet & greet guy that opens the taxi door for you. He also got us a taxi when we needed,5 out of 5,November 2022,5.0 of 5 stars,#82 of 372 hotels in Singapore,0.01816666666666667,0.544,50.90833333333333,54.400000000000006,Value,1.816666666666667

I wish them has Middle East option as well. The concierge guy Deneal was very helpful in answering and clarifying any questions you might have regarding a place and best way to get there.

Grand Copthorne Waterfront,Disappointing Grand Copthorne.,We stayed here for three nights and that was plenty. The rooms were quite nice but that was about it. The reception staff were arrogant and bordered on rude. The fridge was not working so we ordered some ice and were advised it would be 10 minutes and took 90 minutes. Very busy for breakfast where another couple decided to join our table so we were forced to move and the breakfast was of a poor quality. Very disappointing for the price we paid.
