We booked it for two nights but the same day of arrival i decided to extend our stay. Well kept, modern +no carpets in the hallways and I'm the rooms, thank God!) but with respect to tradition.

Sofitel Singapore Sentosa Resort & Spa,My wedding experience at Sofitel Sentosa,"I held my wedding celebration at Sofitel Sentosa on 6 May 2023. My feedback as follows: 1. There was a spelling error on all wedding favours provided. I recall correcting this error with my assigned wedding coordinator before. In my view, for a reputable five star hotel such as Sofitel, getting your guest's name correct is basic work and I am disappointed to find out that little care has been put into getting my name right. 2. There were errors with the room bookings made through the wedding banquet coordinator. A room with cot was registered under someone's name - despite the booking confirmation indicating otherwise. There was a lot of confusion caused by this error and it caused stressed to the bridal parties as it was a very busy day for us. Again, not what I had",1 out of 5,May 2023,5.0 of 5 stars,#5 of 16 hotels in Sentosa Island,-0.0031122448979591854,0.5143877551020408,49.84438775510204,51.43877551020408,0.31122448979591855,Services
