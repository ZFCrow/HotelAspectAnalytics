Arton Boutique Hotel,Much accomplished and helpful,I wanted to look for a place to sleep over two nights. Staffing was very accommodating and showed us our room prior to staying in. She also showed us option if we were wanting to upgrade with more room and balcony options. To me that‚Äôs a plus to have option in a place that I have never been.

Arton Boutique Hotel,Terrible management and customer service,"We made an accidental booking via Agoda to the hotel as the Agoda app had saved our credit card details. When we realised this mistake, we called Agoda and the hotel within 5 minutes of the accidental booking to let them know it was a mistaken booking. The policy does state that it is non refundable. One of their reservation staff told us that there was nobody from management in to speak to us at 5.30pm on a Thursday. Subsequently, the reservation staff were really rude to us on the phone after further communications. For 3 days, the hotel management did not contact or communicate with us even after our repeated calls. Now, we received a note from Agoda that the hotel has decided NOT to grant us any refund for this.

Arton Boutique Hotel,Bad Experience and Service,"This hotel charges clients for any stains on the bed sheet, which can be easily washed off using stain removal and furthermore the stain is accidental.

Potential customers beware! Please do not stain the bed sheet, coffee, urine, menses or makeup, they will make u pay! And also it feels like they target certain customers to pay.

Two people in that room would be incredibly close quarters. Pros: very clean with great wifi. My only con really was the fact that the hot water did not last for very long in the shower. There's not much to do in this area but the bus and MRT are within a short walk.,4 out of 5,December 2016,3.0 of 5 stars,#190 of 372 hotels in Singapore,0.28833333333333333,0.5656140350877192,64.41666666666667,56.561403508771924,Value,28.833333333333332

Arton Boutique Hotel,Great location but small room,"I have stayed at hotel chains such as Hotel 81 and Fragrance Hotel before therefore I did not have much expectation with this hotel. I booked this because it has one of the best rates with unbeatable location. The room is small, but since I travel alone, it fits just nice. It is a window-less room, but that doesn't bother me as I was staying for a night. Room is adequately equipped - safe deposit box, mini toiletries and mineral water. Location is within 10-minutes walk away from Lavender station.

Arton Boutique Hotel,Worthy Boutique Hotel,"Considering all the costly hotels in Singapore, I think booking this hotel was a great choice. It is not expensive yet very clean and comfortable to stay at. The room is small, like there's literally no space for your big luggage but I find it cute and you can actually maximize spaces underneath and beside the bed. They have aircon, cable TV, very fast WiFi, safety deposit box, electric heater, hot and cold shower and hair dryer. They also provide complete bath essentials. I mean, if you are just staying to sleep after a very exhausting city tour, this would be an awesome choice. The bed is very comfy. It is a 10-minute walk from Lavender station and there are restaurants nearby. The receptionists are very nice and helpful too.",5 out of 5,April 2017,3.0 of 5 stars,#190 of 372 hotels in Singapore,0.19612745098039214,0.6722058823529413,59.806372549019606,67.22058823529413,Value,19.612745098039213

Arton Boutique Hotel,Yucks! Sheets were not changed!,"I do not recommend anyone to stay at this hotel. If you insist, do stay at this hotel if you don't mind: 1/ Bedsheets, pillow cases and quilt covers not changed with hair and makeup stains on the old sheets. 2/ Being told by the reception that he is the only staff working at midnight and he can change the sheets only at 8am the next morning. 3/ Changing your own bedsheets and pillow cases and seeing clumps of hair on the old sheets 4/ Paying a higher price than a backpacker inn, and not getting the basic hotel standards. Beats me when was the last time the sheets was changed. This is the basic requirement for any hotel and this hotel clearly did not strive to attain any standards.

Arton Boutique Hotel,Good service and care,"I'm staying at this hotel with my sister since 21 November for 5D4N. The room was very small but cute, untill on the 2nd day felt uncomfortable because of the room smell musty, so we asked if possible to change and get another room because my sister is pregrant and felt sick. They show attentive by sending a person to check on our room. Next day, on the 3rd day morning the management called us and let us know they have a room ready. The room is nice and beautiful, very roomy for my sister can feel more comfortable to stay for the next 2 more day.

Arton Boutique Hotel,Disappointed second visit,"I have stayed here twice. One in early January, and actually came for a second visit in late January because of the convenience location and a reasonable price. However i was very disappointed on my second visit as i lost my samsung tab here. As any other traveler who brought more than one gadgets and put in the luggage, when they travel around. I did the same, came back and surprisingly shocked when it wasn‚Äôt there when i got back in the room. I was very upset that someone other than me have the access to the room and searched to my belongings and took valuables thing.

Arton Boutique Hotel,Tiny but Ideal Location,"Hotel is clean, lobby and staff are lovely but the rooms are tiny! You have to climb up onto the bed to get into it, but this did not bother us really as we are agile, but it probably wouldn't suit anyone with mobility issues.

Arton Boutique Hotel,Boutique hotel an Understatement,"Stayed here from July 8-10 and I am going to try to be as objective as possible: Good: Koi pond, communication and service from front desk, location- about 10 minute walk to nearest transit Bad: Size of rooms, really quite surprised by the lack of space (stayed in queen suite) advertised by the hotel, location- still 10 minute walk to nearest transit Ugly: Beware, there is construction going on in the building next to the hotel. Very loud, pulsating, drilling and hammering from the early morning and throughout the day. Had to talk to front desk who moved my wife and I to a loft room. Slightly better soundproof but noise is unavoidable. Worst: Possible mattress ‚Äòinfestation‚Äô in the loft suite.

Arton Boutique Hotel,"The moment we entered, the room ended!!","We took a 2nights stay at this hotel after appropriately researching about the same. But after coming here our perception completely changed. Please don't believe on the pictures shared by hoteliers. They are quite deceptive and misleading. The moment we entered the room, it ended. So if you keep your luggage in the room, you can't even stand!! I can put it the other way round.... Either you sleep on the bed or your luggage rests...:-p There is no latch to the washroom door, the room is pretty cramped and disappointing. Even for an extra bottle of water which we asked at 6am, we were given the reason that you will get it by 9am. So ultimately we had to spend more to purchase water....
