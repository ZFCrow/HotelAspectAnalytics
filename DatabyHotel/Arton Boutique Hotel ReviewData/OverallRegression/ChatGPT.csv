The dataframe shows the percentages of cleaniness, amenities, location, services, general, and value from 2014-2023. 

Overall, we can see that cleaniness has steadily increased over time, with an overall average of 53.52%. In 2021, the cleaniness percentage was the highest of the years, with a percentage of 72.05%. Amenities similarly have shown steady improvement, with an average of 59.69%, and 2019 being the highest of the years, at 69.48%. 

Location has had the most consistent percentage with an average of 54.86%, with 2018 being the highest of the years at 58.97%. Services also have remained relatively consistent, with an average of 51.57%, and 2019 being the highest of the years at 54.69%.

General have seen the greatest improvement, with an average of 59.89%, and 2021 being the highest of the years at 72.05%. Value has had a relatively consistent percentage, with an average of 56.21%, and 2020 being the highest of the years at 61.52%. 

To improve these percentages, cleaniness could be increased further to bring the overall average up. Amenities could also be improved to achieve a higher average. Location and services should remain consistent while general and value should continue to increase to reach its highest possible percentages."
