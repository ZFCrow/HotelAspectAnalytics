I had hoped the hotel had other means of contacting them, like sending an email. I even put up my questions on their social media sites, but without success. Eventually, I resorted to calling the hotel to get an answer. With the app, I also found the chatbot very useful and the responses prompt. The check-in process was quick and safety measures are in place, so I know the hotel is doing whatever it can to assure guests that their safety is important. As with other lodging properties, there are booking slots for the use of the facilities.

The refillable dishes consisted of a prawn pumpkin bisque and mushroom soup, turkey, steak (cooked to a perfect medium rare!) and fish among other things.

Being a platinium member in both Accor and Marriot group i must say this is the worst customer experience i have had in all the hotels i stayed in Singapore, not to mention Asia Pac. Apart from its extreme old rooms , the worst experience i have had is having to face the service staffs who totally lack interest to facilitate customer requests. The front desk manager Alvin Tan needs to take direct responsibility for the lack of motivation from his staff as he too is unwilling to go the extra mile to take care of Marriot Loyal platinium members.

The wagyu egg ball was too dry and we could not have a refill of the miniscule savouries in the bottom tier. The 'scones' turned out to be little muffins in texture and taste.

Sheraton Towers Singapore,Nice stay over CNY 2022,"As everyone knows, there are a lot of hotels in Singapore and there are no shortages of 5* hotels. I don‚Äôt know if I would classify the Sheraton Towers Singapore as a 5*, definitely more than 4*, but I think it is a little older property and with the surroundings, i would classify it as a solid 4.5*. Location is good if you‚Äôre coming from the MRT, the Newton MRT station is less than 5 minutes walk, but it‚Äôs a little further away from the action of the true Orchard Road. Which might be a plus for some. For me, there is nothing wrong with the property, it is a solid property, but you have to compare apples to apples, and comparing it to some newer properties in the Suntec/Central District, it is not up to par.

Sheraton Towers Singapore,Great hotel; Amazing Staff,"I had the pleasure of staying here for business purposes recently with my team, and I must say: this was one of the best business stays I've had in the last few years.

The lobby is kept immaculately clean, and the front desk staff are so nice! My favorite part of my stay had to be the staff, though. From the door people to the kitchen staff, they went above and beyond to make sure everybody felt comfortable.

Sheraton Towers Singapore,Very Nice Overall,"Stayed here for 5-nights on points, and upgraded to a suite (used SNAs). Professional and helpful staff always willing to assist. While the hotel is older, the amenities/furniture/facilities are OK. As a Titanium elite, breakfast was included (tons of variety). One minor complaint is that there's no hot noodles (soup). Cooked-to-order omelette/eggs was nice. I also had the opportunity to visit the Executive Lounge (kids not allowed though) for afternoon tea. Decent afternoon delights. Swimming pool is nice (located on the 5th floor) and it's a decent size. Very kid-friendly (deepest end is about 4.5 feet). Location is pretty good. While it's not within walking distance to any shopping, this hotel is very close to the Orchard Road shopping district.

Sheraton Towers Singapore,My favourite Hotel,"Absolutely outstanding Hotel. We planned on staying at a different hotel on our return to Singapore in March but this was so good that we switched our booking to stay here on both legs of the journey. Location is good, very near to Newton MRT station. Reception was amazingly helpful. We arrived exhausted, at 9:30 am on 21st Feb and the lady let us go for a coffee in the Executive Lounge until our room was ready. Ten minutes later, she appeared in the lounge (3rd floor) and personally handed us our room keys. On our second stay we were allowed to check in even earlier!

Sheraton Towers Singapore,Disappointed Customer,Very disappointing stay. Sheraton Towers was a final hotel in a four week trip around SE Asia. From the muted welcome to a damp room with damp bed linen and some other irksome issues my stay at the Sheraton Towers was a let down. Things can go wrong and it is the response from the hotel that finally impacts on any assessment. Yes the room was changed and the damp problem resolved. As an unhappy customer I suggested that a manager may wish to contact me to discuss the issues. my expectations were obviously too high. Contact was only made after my departure and tweeting Marriott Bonvoy. The email offered the usual perfunctory 'cut and paste' reply which only adds to the disappointment. Sheraton Towers fell short of the standards expected from a 5* hotel. there were too many,3 out of 5,February 2023,5.0 of 5 stars,#14 of 373 hotels in Singapore,-0.09709150326797386,0.6566993464052289,45.14542483660131,65.66993464052288,9.709150326797387,General

Sheraton Towers Singapore,Great Hotel and Greater hospitality!,"The hotel is one my most liked as it provides u easy access to public transport and the busy Orchard area. Not only that, if u like short distance runs, you can reach Clark Quay / Marina Bay Sands/ Bugis/ Little india in 20-30 mins (all around 3km from the hotel). On top of these benefits, the icing on the cake is the service on the live counter when u go for breakfast. Although, all chefs are great and friendly, Kelvin Lee needs a special mention. He would cook my specific ‚Äú3 egg omelette, all veggies, no meat‚Äù with utmost precision and patience to ensure it is well done.

Sheraton Towers Singapore,Happy to be back!,Had a wonderful return visit to the Sheraton Towers in Singapore (April 8-17) which was as lovely as ever. From the door staff greeting us on arrival to the room staff on level 20 (and every facility in between!) we had great service and attention from all the staff. Loved our suite (Havana) and really enjoyed lazing by the pool. The breakfast each morning was delicious - especially the eggs and omelettes prepared for us. The Towers Lounge staff were great - especially Grace and Sheehan(?) who looked after us so well. Thank you.

Sheraton Towers Singapore,Classic Sheraton Hotel,"This was the first Sheraton hotel that I have stayed thus paving my way to stay in Sheraton Hotels if given a choice. I love the majestic lobby with the high ceilings and the whole grandeur feel to it. The Reception could do with more smiles as they looked stressed every time I see them. The rooms are however very tired and might need some upgrading. Happy to see that the hotel finally have an executive lounge during my visit last year. The swimming pool is getting old but I like my room which is have direct access to the pool. My preferred room.

Sheraton Towers Singapore,Great Introduction to Singapore !,"Our first visit to Singapore and this hotel made for a great first impression. Taxi from Changi Airport was only $25 SGD far less than I had expected. The hotel is located less than a one minute walk to the Newton MRT Station which is the intersection of the Red and Blue lines. While a bit removed from Marina Bay, the MRT gets you there in less than 15 minutes. The beds were Marriott comfortable and the showers had strong pressure. Admittedly, the temperature could vary a bit even after setting... The Executive Lounge was large and comfy. However, we have seen more variety at other Marriott lounges for the breakfast and ""dinner/cocktail"" spreads.

Sheraton Towers Singapore,"Serene, Yet Close to Orchard and the Singapore Action","This hotel is a short walk from famous Orchard Road, but it feels miles away. It is in an upscale part of town, where trees and greenery start to become abundant. The hotel itself is excellent. My room was comfortable and spacious, and the bathroom had everything one could want. The Executive Lounge was quite good (though exceedingly popular one night ... a situation that the staff handled with extraordinary graciousness and aplomb), and the team members could not have been nicer or more professional. The main restaurant is excellent, and offers both buffets and a full menu. The pool and gym are superb. I give this hotel super high marks for its Business Center. The computers are top notch, and even better, so are the printers, which actually work! Amazing and impressive!

The gym is above average for a hotel standard, but you'll need to navigate the hoards during peak morning periods. Most concerning however is the exorbitant prices for F&B.

Its location is relatively quieter since it is not right in the center of the shopping avenue and it is about a 15 min ride from the Marina Bay (depends on traffic).

The lounge room is relatively small, and the configuration of the seats is rather awkward as the seats are very close together and the sofas are placed for a group of 3.

Sheraton Towers Singapore,No reason to stay in Sheraton,Very small rooms in so called 5 star hotels. We were family of 4 (2 + a 7 yr child + 1 Infant). They asked me to buy extra room as the room can't accommodate 4 people even if it includes infant. There is many 5 star hotels in near by in same or lesser rate and not such restrictions. I am also a gold member of Marriot. Surprisingly they asked me to pay approx $102 (incl taxes) per day for breakfast for 2 adults since I was planning to use my points for stay..and its fast expensive than other 4 or 5 star hotels chargding $20-25 per head for B.F. And if I book same hotel from outside I was getting approx SGD 200 with breakfast included.

At this hotel, I was finally able to find my 'oasis' in terms of an excellent hospitality experience in Singapore.

Sheraton Towers Singapore,"Strategically Located, Well Maintained Property but requires certain improvements",We are currently staying this property for eight nights. The hotel is located less than a mile from main shopping area along Orchard Rd. The hotel is situated at Scotts Rd. which is about 25 min. cab ride from Changi Airport. Even though the property is many years old the management have undertaken lot of refurbishment over the years. We have stayed here many times over a 25 yr. period. The rooms are decent size but don't have free standing Showers which is a major setback for me. The Fitness Area is aged & crowded. There is little room to do stretching or weights. We have on this trip experienced long waits to be seated for breakfast. The restaurant staff are not capable of organisation talents.

Sheraton Towers Singapore,Disappointed,"I wouldn‚Äôt stay at the Sheraton Towers Singapore. I suppose If you are just seeking a comfortable bed at a higher-priced hotel near the Newton MRT station, then this Sheraton fits the bill. But if you seek a solid hotel experience with welcoming staff, this is not your hotel. The lobby is the opposite of warm‚Äîa dark and cold cavernous space, with a couple of cheap-looking couches places to the side as an after thought. No greetings, no friendly smiles as you approach the front desk. The worst example of poor customer service is Tammy, the breakfast greeter. She seats guest for breakfast‚Äîwith no smile, no eye contact, refused my request for another quieter table, and epitomizes what is wrong with this hotel‚Äîlack of warmth and friendliness.",2 out of 5,January 2020,5.0 of 5 stars,#14 of 373 hotels in Singapore,-0.2261363636363636,0.5272727272727272,38.69318181818182,52.72727272727272,22.61363636363636,General
