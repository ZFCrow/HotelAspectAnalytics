Finally, General's sentiment score experienced the greatest fluctuation, with a steep rise from 54.6% in 2018 to 65.3% in 2022. 

To improve across all aspects, there should be a focus on Cleanliness, which started off with the lowest score. More attention should be paid to providing a clean and hygienic environment for visitors. Additionally, there should be a focus on improving Services, which have remained at a steady range for the past 5 years. Possible solutions include offering more efficient and faster service, as well as diversifying the services that are available. Finally, more effort should be made to keeping amenities up-to-date, as the score increased in recent years but still remains below 70%."
