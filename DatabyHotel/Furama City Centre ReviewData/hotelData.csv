Furama City Centre,Still a very good reliable hotel in Chinatown.,"My stay for 7 days has been pleasant and exceeded my expectation of this somewhat older hotel. I fully understand its age and conditions, but it was sellingvat a very reasonable rate, I chose it for it's prime location and spacious rooms. I was not at all disappointed. Upon check in, I was welcomed and assisted by a friendly staff Imah. She sunrises me by granting me an upgrade to the executive floor. That truly made my 7 nights all the more awesome! The room has wonderful view, and things are in good working condition. Very good fast wifi I really couldn't find anything to complain about.",4 out of 5,February 2023,4.0 of 5 stars,#123 of 372 hotels in Singapore,0.4412500000000001,0.6675,72.0625,66.75,44.12500000000001,General

Furama City Centre,Nothing like a 4* star hotel,"There are better 2* star hotels than this one. Definately not star, 3 at a push. The rooms are nothing like you see on the website. The 'Superior' room I stayed in was small, old-fashioed, tatty and had a strange smell. The bathroom shower , over the bath is terrible and the shower curtain inadequate. If you are lucky you might get hot water, though its not guaranteed. The aircon is noisy and the TV has 4 channels. No instructions on how to use TV. No menu for inhouse food. Buy your own water for cofee and tea as the water from the tap is greasy. Rooms arent cleaned unless you beg and the reception are unfriendlly and inefficient.

Furama City Centre,"Excellent location, friendly staff","I previously stayed here in March 2020, and was delighted to return this time for the Chinese New Year celebrations. Times have necessitated some cutbacks but I didn't find that an issue at all; toiletries, etc were available to choose from at reception, and there was a water filling station just along the corridor from my room. My room had a great view looking out towards the Singapore Flyer and although the décor was a little jaded, the room was clean and the facilities were fine. Breakfast was adequate, but a little more choice from day to day (I was there 5 days) would have improved it. All staff I had contact with were friendly and pleased to help.

Furama City Centre,Wonderful stay in Standard room 16th floor,One word - Excellent! I travelled from New Delhi(India) to Singapore along with my family. Booked standard room which had a king size bed and a baby cot. I was a little cautious while checking-in (late checkin) as I had read very bad reviews about the hotel (old/archaic/not well maintained). To my pleasant surprise the room was all ready - I barely had to wait 2 min before I was given the room keys. Very courteous reception staff. In room dining - they charge you 5SGD extra each time - better you have your meal at Tiffany's (their restaurant). We had ordered prawn curry and rice along with Pasta - loved both. This hotel is bang middle of Chinatown with Clarks quey right opposite and Very close to Central Business District.

Furama City Centre,Don’t stay here,"Just spent 5 days at Furama City Center hotel and the service was atrocious! This is rated as a 4 star hotel and despite staying in a deluxe room, the building itself is dated. The hotel is trying to save costs so the guests have to use a self service QR code to order hand towels, floor mat etc. If you need toilet paper, you have to go to the lobby area and you can pick it up from a central area where they have coffee, slippers and other items for your room. In other words, you need to pick it up yourself! Don’t expect it will be replenished in your room when it is finished! Rooms are only cleaned every 3 nights as per the official hotel guidelines although ours was cleaned by the 4th day after I went to talk directly to the hotel staff in the lobby.

Furama City Centre,Not suited for Holidaying families. Dated property and poor service. Rude staff.,"We were a family (with two kids) and had booked the property for 5 days (from 29th Nov-4th Dec). It all looked okay from outside. However, when we reached the front office, it was a congested place with rude staff. The front desk person quoted a higher price for our stay than was quoted on the booking portal and only after a slight argument and proof of the booking, did he budge and took the correct amount.

Furama City Centre,Disappointing Stay,Our stay in this hotel started reasonable but unfortunately deteriorated over the length of the 8 days. The room is dated and one of the bed mattress shown sign of being well worn. The room appears reasonably clean although we were not aware that room service is only after the 3rd day of stay. The room unfortunately has a musty smell but if you don't mind the smell the overall size of the room is acceptable. The bathroom is dark with poor ventilation and fogs up easily after a hot shower. The operation of the shower is a hit & miss with the mixer tap very difficult to control. You either get very hot water or cold depending on the day. On the 3rd day of our stay there was no hot water so only cold shower. We were not informed of what happened.

Furama City Centre,Definitely worth a stay!,"We booked an executive club room without thinking about specifiying (bar adding on that we had a 3 yeat old child) an extra bed for our kid - oops on us! The room itself was absolutely fab, and amazing views, and would be perfect for couples or a family with a child young enough for a cot. The staff here (especially Imah) was such a great help and moved us to a family room, with loads of space and a bed for a little one. We could have cried with happiness! Still an amazing view, and a very very happy kiddo. Breakfasts are great with a huge range of choices. We also love the location near China town and Clarke Quay, and it's easy to get to the trains and catch a taxi. The best thing about this place is the most wonderful staff.

Furama City Centre,Wonderful Stay,I booked 2 nights here for an executive room. The hotel building connected to the building nearby and the shopping mall so it's easy to go everywhere and the MTR station was just one block away. It's in the middle you could take the train from either Chinatown Station or Clark Quay station. We were upgraded to a big room with a separated living room area and the kitchenette which we enjoyed very much as most rooms in singapore were small but this one was spacious. The view from the room was also fantastic overlooking the Singapore Flyer and the Esplanade. The Breakfast was good with many choices. A bit con for me was the lounge which was located on the same floor as the lobby and it was quite small and not so private.

Furama City Centre,Great stay with a few minor issues but probably the best value in Singapore for a family of 4.,"We stayed for 9 days in one of the family rooms. Furama City Centre is one of the only hotels I found that can take 4 people in one room as it has family rooms with small kitchenette and good sized fridge, along with a queen bed, a single bed and a sofa bed. Most other hotels in Singapore seem to have a maximum of 3 guests per room which is frustrating for a family of 4. The other great option for this hotel is they have connecting rooms available if you didnt need the kitchenette. The positives: Great price if you book early, and stay for more than 7 nights, among the cheapest in Singapore but for a huge room for 4! Location was fantastic, a 2 minute walk to the Chinatown MRT station, which happens to also be at Chinapoint mall with lots and lots of food and a supermarket",5 out of 5,July 2022,4.0 of 5 stars,#123 of 372 hotels in Singapore,0.24857142857142858,0.5909523809523809,62.42857142857143,59.09523809523809,24.857142857142858,Value

Ball room remained stuffy and sweltering for about an hour or so, before the banquet staff, ballroom manager, and hotel management conspired to rectify the situation by bringing in...one small fan. Obviously the fan was pointless...so the hellish conditions continued. Not sure for how long this was endured, since we left after watching the weak response to the disaster. Felt for the couple, who looked distraught, since we weren't the only ones walking out of the ballroom. Can't blame people for leaving though. Safety comes first.

The room was very bright and big and quite comfortable though the air conditioning was noisy and the pillows too thick but that must be a Singapore thing as I tried to buy a thin one everywhere and couldn’t.

Let me say the staff is very friendly and accommodating but the pictures on the website/s do not match the hotel. This hotel is advertised as a 4 star hotel but I believe by Australian Standards is more a 3 - 3 1/2 star hotel.

My suite that I was initially assigned was very dated and not the cleanest and smelt. The bathroom had mold and I requested another room.

Firstly, the location is absolutely great. Very close to the MRT station (Chinatown - Blue Line). A taxi/cab is very easily accessible. Right opposite to People's Park Center and Chinatown Point Mall. Staff is quite cordial, but I found a little difficult to communicate, probably due to the limitations of their English accent. On one instance at the executive lounge, the server didn't server my drink, even after multiple reminders.

Furama City Centre,"Very 80s and a bit daggy, but clean and comfortable","In Singapore, you generally have a choice: you can pay a ridiculous amount of money for an OK hotel, or you can pay sensible money for a hotel room that's so small that you have to walk sideways to get past the bed, and there's nowhere to put your luggage. Or you can stay somewhere that's miles out of town. The Furama, weirdly, is none of these. It's cheap - I paid somewhere in the region of S$100-150 per night (it was part of a package, so it's hard to be sure exactly) - but it's in the City Centre (the clue is in the name), and the rooms are a decent size. It reminds me of one of the faded 80s and 90s State-owned hotels in Beijing: there's a faded grandeur with a high, formerly-grand internal lobby and lots of beige marble, but it's deeply unfashionable.

She was too lazy to go get the pillows. 3 Days in a row we placed the “Please make up my room” sign and each day we had to call reception on after our outing 3pm ish to let them know our rooms were not made up.

Furama City Centre,I DONT recommend this.,"Exterior looks grand, like it was once a 5-star hotel. Interior, shows its age and the lack of upkeeping/renovation. We stayed in rom 919.

It made me feel everything in the room are dirty and moldy. - The shower hot/cold water pipe are HORRIBLE. If you turn on the hot water first and then the cold water to cool, the hot water only gets hotter as the hot water into in the cold water pipping.

Furama City Centre,Really a good budget hotel for this location,"A great hotel for the cost and location, clean, we'll appointed rooms, walking distance to Clarke Quay/ Fort Canning Park, Lau Pa Sat for evening dining. DT19 subway station just across the road which will take you pretty much anywhere for cents. The only criticism is it's largely self service, no help to get your luggage to check in on the 2nd floor ( but many guests tried an array of methods sending theirs unattended up or down the escalator). Scan the QR code for ordering anything from the restaurant (Tiffany's) and good luck navigating the program if you're over 40.

Furama City Centre,Furama City Centre a good choice for the budget conscious.,"I chose Furama City Centre as our base in Singapore for a few reasons. Firstly, for its proximity to a host of 'go to' places like Chinatown, Little India and Kampong Glam, Clarke and Boat Quays, Marina Bay Sands and Gardens on the Bay, Sentosa, The Fullerton, Orchard Rd and Raffles, and MRT stations and bus routes. Secondly, the price...most hotels nearby were much more expensive. Thirdly, the hotels nearby that were in our price bracket had very tiny rooms with beds jammed up against walls and nowhere to swing a cat let alone to spread out. What we found was a hotel past its prime but functional, clean and quiet. The bed was too hard for me but lots of people like hard beds so that was just my bad luck.

Furama City Centre,Don’t waste your money. Staff rude. Basic hotel,"Service was terrible. Staff are rude. Room was basic, very musky smell throughout whole place.

Very close to MRT and Chinatown, great breakfast, lovely front desk staff (could do with more staff in busy check in/out times), very helpful concierge.

Furama City Centre,Excellent location; value-for-money.,"Our family of 4 stayed here for a week to accompany my son and his team to an international basketball tournament. The location is the best for the purpose of our trip! A lot of affordable food choices nearby, and very accessible to public transport. There was a time we came from shopping at Orchard Road and it was raining and late at night. Without having to take the taxi but just the train, we got to the hotel without getting a drop on us! thanks to the connection of the hotel to a nearby subway stop. We did not get to try their breakfast buffet because we opted for the local kopi shop at the mall beside. While there were 4 of us, we split into 2 rooms, just to be clear about it. the room is spacious, I found the bed comfortable and a good size.

Furama City Centre,Disappointing ....,"While the hotel is in a good location and close to public transport, our stay at the Furama was disappointing. Despite us emailing the hotel in advance that we would be late arriving, no non-smoking double room was available for us, despite us having pre-paid. The room we were allocated was tired and worn. We were woken most nights during our stay by loud persistent noises in the corridors by other guests. No arrangements were made for us to move to a double room when one came available. On a positive, housekeeping was great.",3 out of 5,March 2023,4.0 of 5 stars,#123 of 372 hotels in Singapore,0.1215909090909091,0.4597943722943723,56.07954545454545,45.97943722943723,12.15909090909091,General
