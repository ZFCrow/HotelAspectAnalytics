It was such a pleasant surprise for us. Such gesture is thoughtful which i believe many other places will not bother.

Concorde Hotel Singapore,"Location, Service top class",Location is great. Free parking too. Only found the price slightly on the high side and the room is a bit dated especially the bathroom. The power points at the desk were not all working and I thought I'll be getting a bigger room because I booked a triple deluxe room but it's just a standard room with an extra bed thus there wasn't any space left for the mini table in the room to be usable.

Concorde Hotel Singapore,Tired but okay,Just got back from a two-night stay at the Concorde in Singapore. Went for an international conference held at the hotel. The room we were given was right beside the pool so we had the keep our curtains closed most of the time since we didn't feel comfortable people being able to see inside our room. We had a king-size bed with a terrace. The room was very spacious but you can smell that the carpet was old. My rhinitis was going crazy but an anti-histamine a night helped. The shower was also spacious and I appreciate that the shower knob was right at the entrance of the shower to avoid that shock of cold water. The toilet seat was a bit wobbly so it was tricky but we managed. I appreciate that the toilet had a bidet sadly the water pressure was too low.

Lovely foyer and my 3 year old loved the lifts with the view of the foyer. Rooms were good, although two armchairs would have been nice. No bath but shower was large enough for her to shower with me. Kids pool was great but quiet cool due to the shade over the top. The main pool was good for a me as it’s 1.2m all the way so I could walk up and down with my daughter easily. This pool was warmer as no shade cover so got the warmth from the sun! Room service was an average of 20min which was good.

Concorde Hotel Singapore,Bad experience! NOT RECOMMENDED!,"I checked in very late at night, so tired and found that the fridge was not working. (Room 509) As I need to put something I bought for food&drinks. Then I call one stop service. The answer was no there was no problem about the fridge in this room. Therefore I insisted that there was!!, staff said “we’ll send someone” and there was no someone in at least 20 minutes of waiting. I decided to change the room and go sleep with my colleague room on 4th floor. Towel on the toilet floor was not prepared in the room. The worst part was that there was a surprise wake up call for me by the loud sound of constructions at 10am, screwing and smashing non- stopping.

Our Singapore Airlines flight got in at 7.30 and we arrived at the hotel at 9am. Much too early to check in but the hotel was very obliging knowing that we were tired from our long flight and made our room available early. We only had to wait an hour and were very grateful - enjoying a shower and a snooze before we headed out to explore Singapore. The food was great - especially the Seafood Banquet as being hotel guest we were charged only 2 for price of one. The day we checked out our flight was not until late evening so they made a shower room available for us to use and into travel clothes. Highly recommend Concorde Hotel Singapore.

This was much better but still not amazing, the bathroom was very nice but the room was badly painted and the balcony door had been broken and now locked with a hook and eye which caused a few problems with the aircon.

Great location as close to MRT and shopping on Orchard Rd. The only suggestion is easier access from reception to Orchard Rd without having to walk around from other side of the building for persons with prams/strollers. The only downside is the restaurant and room service with prices very expensive.

Only negative on the room itself is that the interior is probably due for a refresh (signs of wear and tear, and even some mould/mildew building up in the bathroom and the air-vents), but the room was otherwise clean and suited our family. We had family staying in two premier rooms on a different level which looked recently renovated and were very clean. Their rooms also included free laundry service and food and beverage credits, which were extremely generous and great value.

Concorde looks real nice in the pictures, but unfortunately, you'll walk in to find that it's quite cheap on the inside, almost at the quality of freeway motels in the US. When I walked into my FIRST room, I had trouble finding the light switch - they have switches for the hallway and bathroom near the front door, but you'll have to walk to the bedside for the bedroom light switches. The reason I describe the light switch placement is because I felt drops of water falling on my head, leading me to quickly realize the pool of water collecting right at the entrance to the room.

The staff in the Premier Lounge were especially attentive and polite, top marks to them; Cons: Reception staff at check in (at 10:30pm) were abrupt and perfunctory and made us feel like we were a bit of a nuisance to them ( this wasn't the same with other staff on other days); The hotel needs a do-over with it showing its age.

The hotel staff and facilities were great and the breakfast in the morning was ample, diverse and well prepared. The location of the Hotel is excellent, with shopping and restaurants merely steps away. Public transportation is easy, so moving about if you have time to explore is really a no brainer. My only small issue was the shower enclosure. Since the showers are tiled with very dark tile, it may be easy to overlook stains and mold in a general daily cleaning. I unfortunately noticed some mold/ mildew in the corners, in the areas under the shower and soap dispensers. I made sure not to step there and averted my eyes when I showered. A clean shower is always something that I notice at a hotel.

In our case particularly, it was for some late last minute Christmas shopping. Our very comfortable spacious family room came with bunks for our 11 year old twins and a king bed for us.

Concorde Hotel Singapore,Disappointing stay at the Concorde,"This hotel is wildly overpriced and not worth it. The room smelled damp and the shower never dried after use. They are only servicing every third day and the towels also remained damp after 24 hours. There is a kind of balcony in my room but actually the balconies communicate with the rest of the rooms so there is no privacy unless you pull the curtain. Doesn’t make a lot of difference in terms of light because the room is very dark and almost no natural light; the lighting is also not sufficient. Finally, I was very concerned because the sliding doors to the balcony were only secured with a hook eye latch, which seems insufficient to me. The built-in latches on the balcony door were missing the matching latches on the frame, so the only security was the hook & eye.

No info was also given on the unavailability too. The staff were wonderful though. It seems that there is no longer a Handy Phone given with the rooms as the staff explained that the contract with the provider is over.

Concorde Hotel Singapore,A good location for visiting central Singapore,"Excellent and not too expensive hotel on Orchard Road in central Singapore. Great location for both shopping and business meetings. The rooms are spacious and clean. Efficient and friendly staff. The atmosphere is a bit impersonal and a little too classic. Some modern touches could make the whole structure stand out even more. Unfortunately, the area is a bit lacking for restaurants, especially in the evening. The restaurants in the area are mostly oriental and do not offer good international cuisine.

The room we took had a king-sized bed and an additional single bed, which was perfect for our family of 4 (with two young kids) but probably very cramped if they were any older.

Concorde Hotel Singapore,Excellent location & Comfortable Rooms,"With just a 5 mins walk to the Plaza Singapura, which houses the Dhoby Ghaut MRT station., and also a 3 mins. walk to the shopping centers on Orchard Road, you can't beat the hotel's location. The staff are also friendly and efficient, and the newly-renovated rooms now have a proper shower area rather than having to hop in and out of the bath tub for a shower like before!",4 out of 5,July 2019,4.0 of 5 stars,#109 of 372 hotels in Singapore,0.1875,0.3,59.375,30.0,18.75,Amenities
Concorde Hotel Singapore,"Great location, great hotel","The Concorde may not be everyones cuppa tea but for us it was great. Compared to other hotels in Singapore we found this hotel clean, the room was nicely made up, the breakfast (Rita was an amazing lady) was well presented, hot, with lots of variety, the pool was good. The location was great, close to the train/underground and Museums close by. Absolutely no problems at all. We would stay again and regret I did not choose to stay here on our return.",5 out of 5,June 2019,4.0 of 5 stars,#109 of 372 hotels in Singapore,0.43240740740740735,0.7583333333333334,71.62037037037037,75.83333333333334,43.24074074074073,General
Concorde Hotel Singapore,Staycation,Great location in Orchard Road and newly renovated rooms with comfortable bed. Loved the hugh bathroom and definitely friendly staff.
