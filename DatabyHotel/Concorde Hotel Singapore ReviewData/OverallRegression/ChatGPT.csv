Over the years, the overall Cleaniness, Amenities, Location, Services, and General percentages have seen a slight increase. The values for each category increased from 2017 to 2019, and in 2020, there was a drop in ratings for the General, and a slight decrease in Location. In 2021, we see a slight decrease in the Cleaniness and Services ratings, although the ratings for the other categories have remained relatively stable. In 2022, there was a drop in ratings for the Cleaniness, Location, and General categories, although the Amenities rating remained relatively unchanged. In 2023, the ratings for the Cleaniness, Amenities, Location, Services, and General percentages all increased slightly.

To improve these ratings, more attention should be paid to ensuring all areas are well maintained and kept clean. Additionally, amenities should be improved and updated, and locations should be made more accessible and inviting. Services should be enhanced across the board, and customer service should be a priority to ensure that overall satisfaction is increased. Finally, more focus should be placed on fostering a sense of general well being by creating a positive environment and engaging in high-quality customer care."
