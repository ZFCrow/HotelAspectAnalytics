The Westin Singapore,Nice and fine dining meet up,"We had the nice time last night. We catch up and meet up our friendly big brother. We celebrated my Mom’s birthday.

The Westin Singapore,Top Business Hotel,"I have been staying here quite a few nights and I have to say that I am very satisfied. The location is great if you have to work in the Financial Center, there is a Subway Station very close. Despite the fact that this hotel is rather large with 305 rooms, the staff is friendly and professional. I actually like that the rooms are quite modern, very clean and most of them have a great view. The quality of the food in the hotel is okay, I prefer less variety and more quality. The bar in the lobby is decent, it feels a bit cold (I don’t just mean the air con) and could use some more style. The pool is great, but could be a bit larger for swimming (currently under renovation) and the gym is well equipped and has a good view.

The Westin Singapore,"Good hotel, good service; yet nothing memorable","The Westin Singapore is a relatively new property located in the Singapore CBD that is hard to fault. The rooms are immaculate, and the service and staff standard consistent with the Westin brand. However, that is essentially what the property seems to be designed to be: predictable and - dare I say - boring. Which, for the business traveler, could be what is required to get the job done in the past, yet in a city like Singapore where hotel options are aplenty, and the lines between business and leisure travellers aren't as distinct as before, this hotel just doesn't seem well-equipped to cater to today's leisure travellers. There are factors that are hard to overlook purely for the reason that it is a 'business hotel'.

Not to mention the 35th floor swimming pool which has a partial view of the sea (the rest of it is blocked by the newly-built Marina One office tower).

The Westin Singapore,Disappointing,"Generally this hotel is one of my favourite Westin hotels in the world. Mainly this is because of the service. This trip was different. Room service has deteriorated and is not worth it. Food arrived cold and meal was missing items specifically requested. I asked for a large pot of coffee. Was told there is only one size of pot and if that was not enough then I should “feel free” to use the tea pot and instant coffee provided in the room to make more. There was a slimy green salad delivered which was not requested. Perhaps it belonged on another persons tray. The price-value is not there either. For a single half of a grilled tomato, the charge is $8. And instead comes the slimy salad.

For perspective, I am an SPG platinum elite who travels extensively throughout SE Asia, usually staying in SPG hotels but often staying in other 4+ star properties. I travel for fun but like to get a little work done while I'm abroad. Some hotels are flashy. Some are exotic. Some have special gimmicks like casinos or rooftop bars. Some have prime locations. The Westin isn't going to blow your hair back with quirky interiors or street-level access to Singapore's hottest attractions.

The Westin Singapore,Well located hotel with great service,"We stayed at the Westin for a couple of days for our trip to Singapore. The hotel is located in a business district within walking distance to Raffles Place and Lau Pa Sat, one of the best Hawker centers in Singapore. We got a nice spacious room on the top floors with a stunning view over the city including a bathtub in which you can enjoy that view while soaking. The Room contains lots of amenities with a Nespresso coffee maker an TWG tea amongst them. The staff throughout the hotel was very friendly, especially to mention the exceptional housekeeping staff and the ladies and gentlemen in the club lounge. I also recommend booking a club level room. The service and the food in the lounge are great which included also long drinks and proper buffets for dinner.

The Westin Singapore,Great property; amazing stay,I stayed here twice towards the very end of September and into early Oct – and both times had an amazingly wonderful stay made all the more possible by the staff at this hotel. Amir at front desk and Tharani at the Club Lounge. Efficient & professional they both seemed to take pride in their jobs and service with a smile was consistent in my interactions with them during my stay. The property location is convenient to the Downtown MRT line as well as walking distance to plenty of restaurants – and the views from this hotel are just spectacular. Rooms are clean; calming décor and functional. Only thing I wish they had was more USB charging ports near the desk in the room.

The Westin Singapore,Must Read for SPG Platinum Premier Elite,"If you are a SPG Platinum Premier Elite member and are expecting that this property will offer the benefits promised by SPG, like 24 hours check-in, then you will be sadly let down. The staff at the reception will flatly refuse any SPG benefits and will relegate you to a stranger putting aside any SPG Platinum Premier Elite benefits that their program offers. This is not a reflection on the SPG program, but this specific property. The staff is curt, dispassionate and totally inconsiderate. While charging premium rates their only objective is to perform the role of cash/credit card payment collectors while having no desire to serve.

The hotel is new and rooms are nice and comfortable, though as some pointed out there is a noise problem when the housekeeping goes around in the morning to clean up the other rooms, you can basically hear them from the room as they go about their business along the corridors. But not too big a disturbance. Breakfast is fantastic and the gym, swimming pool and spa facilities (whirl pool and steam room) are great. Location is a minus, as it is not near to shopping districts, but it is easy to get around with a nearby MRT station. The only complaint I have is the long check-in and check-out queues.

The Westin Singapore,Fantastic stay at the Westin,"Stayed at the The Westin for my wife’s birthday along with my kid. Was upgraded to the harbour view suite, perhaps due to my SPG member level. The view was great, able to see Sentosa. Service was amazing, a call from the concierge to Ensure everything was fine after checking into the room. The room and amenities looked new and clean. I felt safe for my boy to run around, even on the floor. However, on the meals. I like to feedback perhaps the hotel could offer more variety of food for the lounge. Also, I understand the policy for kids under 12 is not allowed into the club lounge. I do hope the management can review this so the kids can join their parents into club lounge. If not very likely both the parents won’t be able to really enjoy the club lounge, which we did not have",4 out of 5,November 2018,5.0 of 5 stars,#38 of 372 hotels in Singapore,0.3828914141414142,0.5998980186480186,69.14457070707071,59.98980186480186,38.28914141414142,Services
The Westin Singapore,"Clean, efficient, and friendly—one of my best Westin experience",I spent four nights at the Singapore Westin in Nov 18. This is easily one of the best Westin properties that I have ever experienced. They put me in a corner room with both city and bay view. The room has pretty much everything a well-appointed hotel room should have. The gym seems a bit small given the size of the hotel. I would not mind a more extensive collection of gym equipment. The location of the hotel is great with easy access to subway. No complaint in that department. The breakfast served at the executive lounge was decent. I had very limited interaction with the staff. But all those I met were polite and helpful. This is very much one of the best Westin properties that I have stayed with.

Even though we did not have the occasion to see Eunice again, all the other concierges were most helpful (like taking you by the hand to find subway, etc). And, then there was Eunice in the spa.

Why I mentioned rather new, bec many 5 stars hotel worldwide doesn’t earn the fifth or even sometimes the forth due to „a stoppable aging process“. As most of Westin properties I know, the location is excellent. The service is awesome- starting with the warming welcome upon check in (even to a teenager who happened to be in the bad mood) and even after the final check out - as we had a midnite flight home. Our room had both pool and city view. The pool is not huge but it’s an edgy one - overlooking the harbor icl MBS. If you are familiar with Westin, you know the standard of their beds and toilettries.

The Westin Singapore,I love the Westin,"This hotel is really beautiful, you can expect the same level of service and quality everytime. It was our second time in 2 months and they made it a pleasant stay. Rooms are gorgeous and spacious, stunning bathroom. Love the bar and G&T cocktails. Was just disappointed they couldn't accomodate me for high tea again, apparently they were fully booked but we left at 5pm and some people didn't pitch, leaving availability,just something for the hotel to look into. We unfortunately couldn't book online as we were commuting from China and the government blocked our Gmail and Facebook etc. Hotel across La Pau Sat night market, ate the chilli crab, prawns and some Indian dishes,quite convenient from hotel.

The Westin Singapore,One night staycation,"Had a one night staycation recently and really enjoyed the room. Room facilities are well designed and the room was spacious. Was assigned a room facing towards Chinatown. Tried out the workout gear rental at $6 nett. Probably one of my favourite feature of Westin hotels, coming in just after the heavenly beds! Didn't have a chance to join for breakfast, but had a tipple at Cook & Brew. They have a $10 nett promotion on Friday nights and there's also a live band performing, so it's a perfect location to grab a drink to unwind after a long week.

The Westin Singapore,Best Marriott Option in Singapore,"First of all, let me say that among the many Marriott properties that I've stayed in in Singapore, I do think that this is by far the best one and if not for its poorly-located location (specificically for me, as my offices are at the other end of Singapore), I will always choose to stay here. The staff is great, the rooms are extremely spacious with stunning views, the facilities are first-rate, and especially I think the Club Lounge is the best among the Marriott options in Singapore. What also amazes me is how well the hotel was maintained, as it's already six years old (I think) and yet the facilities do look as though they are new.

The Westin Singapore,Excellent choice in business district,"Stayed here for four nights whilst formula one was on. This wasn’t intentional, due to an error on my part I mixed up dates and we ended up flying into Singapore the day before the F1 started. As such the Westin hadn’t been my first choice, but we are very pleased we did end up booking here. Given the expected intake of fans to the F1 we were somewhat apprehensive about crowds, noise etc in the hotel. This proved to be a total non issue. The hotel is in the financial district and close to the downtown and marina bay MRT stations making it easy to get to various places. I can understand some might find the location a bit offputting, but if you prefer to be away from the crowds at Marina Bay etc at night, then it is a great option.

What distinguishes the Westin Singapore, in my opinion, is the unique 32nd and up location in Asia Square; the understanded infinity pool on the 35th floor (No, this is NOT the Marina Bay Sands selfy pool - which is, of course, a lot of fun).

The Westin Singapore,6 Things to Know About Your Stay at the Westin Singapore,"Stayed for 3 nights at the Westin in a Presidential Suite and an adjoining room for my family of 5 adults. The Westin is one of my favorite hotel chains and thus did not disappoint — very clean, ultra spacious and great service! There are just a GM few things that will be helpful for you to know about this location: 1. Location of the hotel seems to be in the business district of Singapore, so there’s not a lot of things to do within walking distance of the hotel.

The Westin Singapore,Post cruise stopover,"We stayed for one day & night post Asian cruise, the hotel was very accommodating to provide an early check-in and upgrade, probably helped that I’ve got a reasonable Bonvoy status. We arrived on a Saturday so the general area around the hotel was fairly quiet as it’s based in the CBD, there are various bars and restaurants in the very close vicinity but most were closed as I presume they support CBD employee’s during Mon-Fri. It is a very modern new hotel, staff are very accommodating and rooms are lovely. We had some drinks at the bar in the lobby and there is an amazing view out towards the islands and cruise terminal through the huge windows.

The Westin Singapore,Nice hotel - not for families,"Westin Singapore: Now this is an interesting post as my husband and I had different opinions on this hotel. We booked a 3 night luxury escapes deal for $999 which included breakfast daily, access to the club lounge, afternoon drinks & snacks and a 3 course meal at cook and brew for 2 adults. Check in was on the 32nd floor of the Asia Square building number 2. This area is where all of the business people would go and I think the hotel is much better suited to them rather than families. The Downtown MRT is across the road a short walk away. Raffles Place MRT is also close by near La Pau Sat where we love to eat.

Despite being away from the main shopping area, the walk to Fullerton and Marina Bay Sands was not that bad.

We ordered food from the room service menu, didn't have high hopes of good food but the food blew our minds. I got the name of the chef from the front desk, thank you Chef Glenn Cooper and team for the fabulous food.

The hotel lobby on 32nd floor was rather quiet and we got our room before 2p.m. The Premier room with city view was big and bright.

Love soaking in the deep bathtub, and the water filled up the tub very quickly too. The highlight of our staycation was definitely the infinity pool on 35th floor. View from the pool wasn’t exactly spectacular as it was partially blocked by the surrounding office buildings. Nevertheless we still had a relaxing good time at the pool.

Have always had a nice room upgrade before but this time no such thing. I had the normal size room. If they claim its a room with a view upgrade then I beg to differ. Who stays in a room for a long period just for the view? Personally would have preferred a bigger room. Was there for only 2 nights, surely this would have been possible. Loyalty to this hotel doesn't count for much. I had emailed them before arrival that housekeeping was not necessary and that all they needed to do was to ensure that enough towels/amenities were available for the 2 nights.

Let me start with the most egregious offense: their complete and utter failure to clarify the promotional offer I mentioned in passing during my booking. Instead of seeking clarification from me personally, they callously charged me the full price without any regard for my intention or understanding of the terms.

Fries that came with the Cheese Burger could also be better with less salt. Nonetheless, the food was fresh & well-made.

The Westin Singapore,Great stay,My husband booked this hotel using his Platinum elite status. We attended a concert at the National Stadium which was about 20 minutes by taxi. It is a beautiful building and the staff were professional and efficient. It is located near many restaurants within walking distance. We requested 2 beds but settled for a King size bed. The room was clean and well equipped. The lounge was very nice and the breakfast and afternoon meals were quite good. Gabriel from the lounge was perfect. He anticipated our needs and everyone's and was very professional and pleasant. The lounge is probably one of the most efficient one I've been to so far and the view was spectacular.

Located on the top floors of an office building, it has great views of the city and the port, though it might soon lose the views on one side due to a building under construction.

The bathroom is really quite luxurious, with a quirky bathtub and a gigantic shower room. The quality of the toiletries and the in-room goodies are of high quality, as should be expected.

The Westin Singapore,Heavenly? Hardly.,"QUICK SUMMARY: disappointing stay, indifferent management, minimal SPG Platinum recognition, downgraded room, avoid unless no other options. I recently spent three nights at the Westin Singapore, and the good news was that it was only three nights. Having spent hundreds upon hundreds of nights in hotels around the world, I know that no hotel is perfect. They all have issues and problems. Some major and some minor, but the sign of good management and training is how these are addressed and resolved. Basically you need a management that cares about its guests, and recognizes that it is not merely renting a room, but offering a service. But what do you do when the problem with a hotel is its management, as is the case here?

The Westin Singapore,I'm moving here!,"Last stop on a recent trip to Vietnam, Cambodia and Singapore and it was worth the wait. We only stayed one night (unfortunately), but it was great. My daughter took full advantage of the pool, my husband and I took advantage of the pool lounge and bar area (the staff here are wonderful by the way)! The front desk staff were fantastic and allowed us to change our bedding arrangements at the last second, which was incredibly helpful and as an SPG member we were given a late check out (fantastic as we had a late night flight) and free wi-fi. We tried a couple of the restaurants which were expensive, but good and the views were fantastic - if you are keen to get out and try the local food however Lau Pa Sat Hawker Centre is just across the road.

There's new buildings nearby under construction thus the view from the pool was obstructed. Honestly I believe this hotel is meant for businessman since it's near office buildings.

The Westin Singapore,"Standard Westin Hotel, probably the best SPG property in Singapore","New hotel with good service & nice facilities, but some teething problems. Terrible buffet restaurant which should be avoided at all costs. SPG recognition: received an upgrade to a suite as an ambassador platinum member, although on a lower floor with obstructed views so it was a little dark. Rooms: new hotel so the rooms are quite nice, with the usual business amenities. Location: Very convenient, walking distance to two MRT stations, nearby food courts & restaurants. Service: Not bad, but not great. Don't let the concierge on the ground floor call you a taxi, instead walk further down to the other tower block where there is a public taxi stand. If not, they'll call you a cab and charge you an extra S$5.

The Westin Singapore,Average/poor - have to iron out some problems,"Our stay at the Westin was short and sweet before we moved off to another hotel in Singapore. Our first impression was not so good, next door to a building site (a lot of places i know), reception not good! Automated an inexperienced people behind the desk. We used a huge booking website to book this room as my husband does for a lot of trips, we stated a king size room and told we could only have a twin despite booking a king via website! Even our email stated king but manager told us it is just a request and booking websites do not have priority it just a request!!! Something worth noting.

My husband is a deep sleeper so it didn't bother him, but I heard the clanging all night long. I recommend asking for a room far away from the construction, but if you're a light sleeper, you may still hear it. Apart from that, it's a great hotel.

The clerk apologized saying they only had the one size - disappointing but understandable. But he then proceeded to call me back 5 min later to offer me another pair - of the same too small size.

The Westin Singapore,"Westin Singapore, Maybe I Had Too Much Expectation.","On a short stopover in Singapore, had a chance to stay couple of nights at the Westin Singapore. As a SPG member, I was so excited that this property was added to the SPG line up. Remember the desire to stay here from the onset, but had no plans to travel to SG anytime soon. So when the time finally came, i was looking to stay at a SPG property and was debating b/w the St Regis or the Westin. Comparing SPG points, it was the same b/w the two properties. I was leaning towards St. Regis, but finally settled on Westin after doing some research and seeing the fabulous pictures. I think the hotel feels very similar to the Sheraton D Cube hotel in Seoul or the Westin in Times Square. But we didn't enjoy it. It was too much of a business hotel, perhaps that was the issue.

The Westin Singapore,Not good at all,The staff services dose not match the hotel. Arrived at the hotel with not assistant to our 2 bags and 2 small bags. We had to handle them to check in level and on to our room. When we arrived to our room. The shower had over flow. It was 2am the plumber came 20mins took him 30 mins to get it fix and another 40 for the house keeping to clean it. So my wife could not get to sleep till 5:30. The toilet always have a strong smell. The staff not willing to do anything(maybe is the weekend). Had not been a great experience. Buffet breakfast is not value for money either. Also i spend 120mins in the spa. The staff was horrible they made enough noise so we could not relax and i had book the spa on sat afternoon the hotel still manage to do a lot of drilling right on the of us.

Amenities, room directory and small add-on's such as a jogging map are a nice touch. However, I was disappointed by the level of service. I was requested to pay an extremely high deposit for 'incidental charges', and as I stayed only 3 nights I found it excessive. Additionally, where in this world in 2016 do you have to pay extra for wifi? Honestly, I believe as a 5-star hotel this is very outdated. Also, I expected a turndown service in the evening, which this hotel only does for VIP guests, and at the poolside there is no attendant or lifeguard, only a receptionist who doesn't move from her desk, which results in",3 out of 5,November 2016,5.0 of 5 stars,#38 of 372 hotels in Singapore,0.1438888888888888,0.7562962962962964,57.19444444444445,75.62962962962963,14.388888888888888,Services

The Westin Singapore,Financial district luxury hotel,"This is a 5* modern hotel in the financial district. It feels a bit impersonal but the facilities are good. The bedroom and bathroom was spacious, quiet, and the bed, pillows and bed linen are probably the most comfortable I have ever slept in! Arriving at 1am after a very long journey, I was a bit irritated that I couldn't immediately find the kettle and tea which most hotels have nowadays. Everything was 'hidden' away amongst the many drawers and wardrobes. My room overlooked a dock area and some construction - not the best - but I expect there won't be a view in a few months!

We were recommended by local friends to stay here whereas I was leaning more towards the Ritz-Carlton. I was not wrong. The lobby and restaurants at Westin are way way too crowded and there isn't enough staff to deal with the number of guests the hotel is hosting and its service very much lacks in finesse compared to the hotels that I have stayed in SGP.

The Westin Singapore,Nothing special + expensive services,"Stayed at Westin for 4 nights for a business trip. Pro's - Clean + spacious room with very nice bathroom (we had euro tub with a city view) - OK view of the city but not much view of the Marina Bay since newly constructed high rise blocks most of the view. - Pool isn't bad, but not super big and view is OK (bit of city, bit of marina, and bit of high rise construction) Con's - Breakfast buffet was around $55 SGD for 1 person and it wasn't all that great to be honest. Yes, it's convenient that it's in the hotel, but price is pretty ridiculous - it's breakfast food and shouldn't cost that much. - Laundry is ungodly expensive - needed to some laundry but cost is more expensive than some of clothes themselves are worth - Location is OK, but not the greatest.

The Westin Singapore,Good rate!,"My husband was offered a good rate by Westin. He took the offer and I am glad he did. Unlike other hotels, the main lobby of this hotel is on the 32nd floor. Nothing fancy about the place. The ambiance is business-like. What particularly caught my attention in the receiving area is the piano sitting in the middle of the room. Every night, a pianist plays lovely music to help guests relax after a long day from work or tour. The hotel is accessible. The taxi drivers know where Westin is. Always say Westin-Asia Square. It is very near the Downtown line MRT. Merlion, Marina Bay, Waterfront Promenade, Lau Pa Sat, Gardens by the Bay, Makansutra and Suntec are just stone throw away from the hotel.

The weather is still sunshine and we decided to go swimming for relaxing. So after we took the room card, we went to the room and lay down the luggage. After 10-15 mins around, we intend to change the swimwear in the bathroom. Suddenly, 2 men, wearing black polo shirt (seems they are house keeping crew) use their card to open my room door and prepare to enter. Lucky, my girlfriend was in the bathroom and I was near the door and taking swimwear at that time. I closed the door right away and we scared a little bit.

Only because I do the bookings and I belong to another rewards program. However when returning to Singapore to visit after two years we decided to try the Westin. We generally stay at the Fairmont because of the location. We were advised by 'locals' that this hotel was far from everything and better to stay closer to good hawker centres. Well in a nice way I would like to say the 'locals' were wrong. This is a great place to stay!

For local food, go north about 400m to Lau Pa Sat for a local food court, although its designed more for tourists these days - still not bad for local tastes and fair pricing. Downside - located in a business district meant limited food and shopping options if you stayed over the weekend like me.

E.g 1) I wanted to order for breakfast the dish that the hotel showed as image on the cover of the breakfast order form hung on the door handle (see attached photo). The response was: 'we don't have that, the picture is for illustration only'. - could the staff be more helpful and try to help me mix and match to come up with the dish? - to hotel management: pls remove this picture.

The Westin Singapore,Good but not great,Excellent location if you want to be close to financial district for work. Brand new in just developing central business district. Nice view of Marina Bay.

The Westin Singapore,Lovely stay,"Stayed at The Westin for an overnight stopover coming home from Europe to Australia. We arrived late in the evening with very helpful staff making check in easy after a long flight. The rooms we great, very comfortable and spacious. Had the order room service as there was really nothing around the hotel open at that time as the hotel is in a business district. Breakfast the follow day was okay, choices are not the best I've ever had but the omelettes are nice. The pool area is on the roof, even though it's small it had a great view of the Bay and cityscape. It was lovely and quiet the day we were there so great for us.

The view from the room was stunning. It also was from the lobby bar on level 32. We ate both days from the Seasonal Taste restaurant also on 32. Good value for a sensational buffet. Definitely try eating here. Great views from the infinity pool and very relaxing. It deserves the 5 rating. Only downside was that I didn't receive any SPG points as I booked through Expedia. It was $200 per night cheaper than booking as a member and so I couldn't walk past it.

The rooms are large and comfortable. The breakfast buffet is the largest I’ve ever seen with options for everyone, and the separate gluten free area is much appreciated as my daughter is on a GF diet. The infinity pool is beautiful and fun on the 35th floor. It is a few blocks walk to China town and there are plenty of good restaurants nearby (Oso at the Oasia Hotel was quite good). It is walkable to the Merlion area (.6 miles), though taxis are pretty cost effective in Singapore, and Uber even more so (roughly half the taxi cost).

However, the hotel all around was better in my mind for roughly the same price.

The Westin Singapore,The best SPG hotel in Singapore,"Westin in Asia was far superior than any Westin(s) in USA. As an example, Westin in Singapore had one of the newest/cleanest building with the friendliest staff. The infinity pool was gorgeous and the executive lounge had amazing spread. Miss Angela Fox was making sure my stay was comfortable and kindly treated the Platinum member with the best room and welcome gift. During my stay here, almost every staff (Fiona, Malcolm, and others) greeted me by my first name. In addition, I was upgraded to one of the best suite with harbor view. On my return to Westin Singapore the next three weeks, I was given the same exact room with chocolate waiting for me in the living room.

The Westin Singapore,Go for the pool!,"Working trip.... but took a minute to check out the amazing infinity pool, high up overlooking the Singapore skyline. Very cool. The hotel is well located near the marina (lovely for a jet lag busting run around), and overall, a modern, stylist hotel. The entrance feels a bit odd (and I challenge you to find the buttons for the lifts on the ground floor...). Well worth a visit... even if just for the pool!",4 out of 5,March 2018,5.0 of 5 stars,#38 of 372 hotels in Singapore,0.247037037037037,0.4538888888888889,62.35185185185186,45.38888888888889,24.703703703703702,Location
The Westin Singapore,Wonderful Hotel,"I have stayed in Westin Hotels around the world; this Westin is a wonderful 5 Star hotel. Modern, clean, cheerful, this Westin has the perfect location to visit Singapore. Though we haven’t taken advantage of the in-house restaurants, they are available. Room service is perfect, the gym is very nice, the pool is beautiful but closed for scheduled maintenance.

The Westin Singapore,Perfect Stay At An Immaculate Hotel With An Incredible Staff,"I recently stayed at The Westin Singapore for two nights with my girlfriend in the middle of a two week vacation. Even from before our visit they had been diligent about emailing us to ensure that all of our needs were accommodated before we stayed. Upon arriving, everything we could have imagined was taken care of, and although Singapore was an early stop on our vacation, The Westin ensured that it would be the most memorable!",5 out of 5,March 2018,5.0 of 5 stars,#38 of 372 hotels in Singapore,0.245,0.41,62.25000000000001,41.0,24.500000000000004,Services
The Westin Singapore,One of the worst hotel I had - even I am a SPG Platinum,"I have to say this is one of the worst hotel I had in my traveller's life, albeit I am a SPG platinum member. I am not going to express my anger here, just write some fact to share: 1) A regular welcome letter and free fruit plate, but the fruit was rotten... Also, there were only one bottle of water in the room, where usually we would have two to four (the Le Meridien Jakarta even gave me 6...). I have to call the staff up to take away the rotten fruit and fill me with more water... 2) I don't care about the upgrade (usually I am entitled to), but the fun part was the receptionist welcomed me and spent 20 minutes to me on why I did not get a upgrade - because the hotel is full. Well, I even did not bother about that, but I was mad because I was tired and waiting for the",1 out of 5,March 2018,5.0 of 5 stars,#38 of 372 hotels in Singapore,-0.0696428571428571,0.5376373626373626,46.517857142857146,53.76373626373626,6.964285714285714,General
The Westin Singapore,Fantastic Hotel,My wife and I stayed here on a recent stop over and must say we wished it had been for a few more days. From the meet and greet at the airport to the drop off the next day I could not fault the whole experience. The staff were extremely helpful and friendly and could not do enough to help make our stay enjoyable. As a Platinum member we we given an upgrade room with a view over the water. The rooms were quite spacious and had all the amenities that you would expect from a 5 star hotel. The club area was very nice as well with an excellent selection of food and drinks. The concierge recommended an excellent Peking Duck place right next door. The breakfast selection was varied and very fresh with eggs made to order. I will definitely stay here again on my next trip to Singapore,5 out of 5,March 2018,5.0 of 5 stars,#38 of 372 hotels in Singapore,0.2768067226890756,0.5021008403361344,63.84033613445378,50.21008403361344,27.680672268907564,Services

The Westin Singapore,I still feel cheated -,"The pictures that the management of the Westin/Starwood have chosen to leave on their website no longer represent reality, I feel let down and cheated as I was sold something that just does not exist, I no longer trust the management of the Westin/Starwood; - Upon checking in we were told the pool and entire pool area are closed for a month. When we booked (mid January) there was no mention of this on their website and we received no email/call to inform us. Angela Fox their manager confirmed they tried to reach out to everyone - I just do not believe they have - I wasn't informed. Angela explained it must have been Expedia (hotels.com) that didn't pass on the message - frankly this is a poor excuse - you as the management of the Wesitin/Starwood are responsible, it's your",1 out of 5,April 2018,5.0 of 5 stars,#38 of 372 hotels in Singapore,-0.0131944444444444,0.4017361111111112,49.34027777777778,40.17361111111112,1.3194444444444446,Services
