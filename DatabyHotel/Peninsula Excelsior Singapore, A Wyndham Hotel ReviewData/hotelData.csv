"Peninsula Excelsior Singapore, A Wyndham Hotel",In desperate need of renovation but can't beat the location,"Reception was busy when I arrived, but I was checked in relatively quickly by a friendly receptionist. I was assigned a room in the Peninsula tower; the other tower is called Excelsior, thus the double name of the hotel. The receptionist said that the rooms in both towers are equal in terms of quality and size. The room was small, almost cramped, and screamed 1995 all over the place. It was worn out but clean. The bed was rock hard and gave me back pain, but on request, they brought an extra mattress pad the next day and after that it was okay. Make sure to ask for that if necessary. There was no socket by the bed (who would have needed that in 1995?). The room came with a desk+chair, armchair+coffee table, fridge (was turned off), safe (was broken), A/C (worked fine) and wifi",4 out of 5,September 2023,4.0 of 5 stars,#136 of 373 hotels in Singapore,0.09950980392156862,0.4091503267973856,54.97549019607844,40.91503267973856,9.950980392156863,Services

The hotel pools were really relaxing and a nice place to chill after a big day out. Also, Fort Canning Park is just a couple blocks away and a beautiful place for an early morning workout.

The concierge were very friendly and helpful and a huge asset to this hotel. The sky lounge was empty when we went up just to look at the lights and I think this is because of their strict dress codes and it is not very well advertised.

"Peninsula Excelsior Singapore, A Wyndham Hotel",Good Hotel,"Stayed at the Peninsula Excelsior Hotel for 5 nights in October with my husband. Very clean, tidy, quiet hotel. Check in and out was timely. Location was fantastic less then 5 minute walk to City Hall Metro and approx. 10 minute walk down to Marina Bay area. 7 eleven convenience store across road with ATM facilities near by. Still a pricey hotel for 3 star but all of Singapore is expensive. Breakfast buffet was plentiful and clean. Rooms were small but clean and tidy. (only bad point would be the small step into the bathroom which we tripped over several times at night so ended up having to leave a bathroom light on! LOL). Gym was equipped with basic needs. Both pools were nice. Front of the hotel was hard to find, a lot of congestion with traffic and road works at that time so",4 out of 5,October 2016,4.0 of 5 stars,#136 of 373 hotels in Singapore,0.11886243386243388,0.5777248677248676,55.94312169312169,57.772486772486765,11.886243386243388,Location

This hotel is comfortable and has an excellent central location. If you are keen on walking, there are a lot of things within walking distance. Even if your comfortable walking range is more limited, there are planty of shoping, eating and entertainment places nearby. If your room is on one of the higher floors, you get a nice view.

The room we had was OK however it was a room at the back of the Excelsior Tower and was on a corner.

Housekeeping was a bit slow on sorting our room and we were not tidied until 5pm one day. Breakfast was included but was average. The location was good as it is near the Raffles shopping mall which has lots of eateries and shops. It is also close to North Bridge Street where you can get the sightseeing bus.

But as far as hotels go it's ok. The most disappointing thing is waking up in the morning and going to breakfast. The buffet breakfast looks ok. The choice of food is limited but stardard fare. The one thing you notice very quickly is that all the food is cold or luke warm at best. Bacon. Cold. Sausages. Cold. Hash browns. Cold. Baked beans. Cold. Noodles. Cold. Then I got to the poached eggs. They were in water under a lamp. Bugger me. They were cold too. I couldn't eat them so I went back to the egg station and tried the scrambled eggs. You guessed it..... COLD!!!! I now know why everybody else was lining up for fried eggs or omelette. They are cooked fresh so they are hot.

Pool access at level L which is the lobby level feels a little weird. Services from all the staff are friendly and helpful - except the guy who did check in for us.

After complaining about the smell were were moved to room on a no smoking floor but we had to accept twin beds rather than the king bed as booked.

Not sure how our requirement for a non-smoking room was overlooked, but it serves as a cautionary tale for those of us that take our right to a no smoking environment for granted. Both rooms had a somewhat worn and dated feel. Tile grout was stained black and minor repairs such as gap sealing, cracks and basin plugs not closing were either neglected or apparently done by unskilled workers.

"Peninsula Excelsior Singapore, A Wyndham Hotel",Unimpressed. Breakfast awful.,"I was travelling solo on holiday, meeting other friends. Check in was efficient and the concierge was very helpful in finding my baggage which Emirates Airlones decided to leave in Dubai. The room was clean and spacious. In the lobby, the barman was a touch pushy but otherwise friendly. My big bone of contention though is the restaurant. On my first night, I dined in and selected two courses, a starter and a main. They brought both courses together! On another evening I visited the de luxe restaurant on the 22nd floor, but it was still the same menu. There was a sauce listed on one of the meals and they couldn't be Elle me what it was, nor could they be bothered to find out. Now if those experiences weren't bad enough, breakfast was even worse.

"Peninsula Excelsior Singapore, A Wyndham Hotel",Good sized rooms in a good location,I first stayed in the Excelsior Hotel over 20 years ago and was interested to see if it had changed much. Many people have said the decor is dated - I have certainly stayed in worse. The rooms are a good size and have tea/coffee making facilities. The staff were nice and happy to help with our queries. We arrived early and our room wasn`t ready but they offered us the use of showers to freshen up and held our bags until we could check in. Our flight wasn`t until late in the evening so again they let us use the showers and pool after check out. There are two pools and the showers in the Peninsular pool area were far superior to the Excelsior Hotel. I prefer the pool in the Excelsior as you can`t be seen from the lobby. The hotel is in a great location very near City Hall,3 out of 5,September 2017,4.0 of 5 stars,#136 of 373 hotels in Singapore,0.3096190476190477,0.6449841269841269,65.48095238095239,64.4984126984127,30.96190476190477,Services

"Peninsula Excelsior Singapore, A Wyndham Hotel",OK Hotel in Good Location,Just back from a 5 night stay at the Peninsular Excelsior. First impressions were good as the lobby was nice but the customer service leaves a lot to be desired. The reception staff member Mary was abrupt and disinterested and no welcome or room instruction was given. Check out was the same. Room was small but comfortable with a view over the park. Air con was great. Difficult to get in and out of the shower as it is over the bath and very narrow. Outdoor pool was nice but with construction happening on both sides of the building meant it wasn't very relaxing. Make sure to go to the Skybar on the 22nd floor as the view is spectacular - don't miss the lightshow at 8pm and 9pm.

"Peninsula Excelsior Singapore, A Wyndham Hotel","Great location, good hotel","Stayed 3 nights and visit to Singapore was after a lapse of over three decades to see the changes to the city. The location was perfect within walking distance to Bugis Street, Chinatown, Clarke Quay, etc. And if walking was a bit much in the heat, City Hall rail stop was very close to the hotel. Didn't eat at the hotel other than a snack with cocktails in the lounge on the 22nd floor which had a spectacular view. Worth having a quiet break up there for that alone. The cocktail menu was interesting as it had drinks that I hadn't seen for years. And so I opted for a Snowball which was Advocaat and lemonade. Opposite the Fire Station around the corner from hotel is a street food centre which had plenty of locals eating and drinking.

It's a nice enough hotel, with 2 lovely pools, but do not expect to sleep. It was massively noisy. I did complain and I was moved rooms but it was no better. Then, there were ants on the desk. I complained again but they refused to give me any monetary refund, which I was appalled at considering how much money I had paid.

The location of the hotel was ideal, only about a 10-15 min walk to the marina, the metro is also very close. 7/11 (food minimart) very close to hotel. Close to raffles.

Unfortunately the discussion became somewhat stressful [for us anyway] before they checked their records. I am surprised that they were apparently unaware that we were arriving on that date although it had been booked, [and paid for], months before.

Very basic, a bit run down. Amenities - the normal business hotels will give you 4 bottles in the shower - shower gel, shampoo, condition and body lotion. This hotel had 2 -shower gel and combined shampoo/conditioner. (Makes me feel like I’m in a motel). Sorry I wish I had kept photos of the bathroom but i couldn’t bare to see them anymore.

"Peninsula Excelsior Singapore, A Wyndham Hotel",Not even close to 4 star,This hotel has one thing going for it - location. The rest is only average at very best so my advice is to find a better one in a similar location. We (14 in our party) stayed here for 4 nights over a 4 week period (once at the start and then at the end of a longer holiday). Safe to say we won't be back. The concierge guys are great with the exception of an older guy who is just surly - get rid of him team as he is bringing you down. There were 14 of us - yes it will be a handful to store our luggage - get over it. Baggage and taxi organising service was well done otherwise. Reception was very disappointing to us both times.

It was selected for us by the Accor Vacation club. Initially we wanted to use club points but... that’s another story. Anyway getting to the hotel from the airport was really easy. Get in the MRT and, with one change of trains, get off at City Hall. A short 5 minute walk got us to the door. Cost only $5. It took longer to check in at the hotel which we found disappointingly slow. Having said that the location is great and the room modern. Wi-fi was available but it keeps on failing.

Check in was ok but they failed to mention where the breakfast restaurant was. The hotel itself is quite old and it shows in the bathroom. Shower is over the very high bath with no grab handles and in my opinion quite dangerous. I had to sit on the side of the bath to get in. Bathroom has been regrouted many times and they haven't bothered to remove the white grout from the brown wall tiles! The rack over the bath was crooked and nearly falling off as were the hooks on the back of the bathroom door. Breakfast buffet was just average. Great location but I was disappointed.

"Peninsula Excelsior Singapore, A Wyndham Hotel",Was not impressed,"I hate leaving bad reviews, but I really was disappointed about this hotel given the cost. The location is good as it is centrally located and close to metro and other major attractions, but the rooms are not impressive. The bed was comfortable. The biggest mistake we made was prepaying for the breakfast buffet. This needs a huge improvement. The food was no better than a Marriott Courtyard hotel. It was pretty obvious the fruit was canned fruit. I highly suggest to save your money and go to one of the many places near the hotel. I also felt like I was being forced to eat at the sky lounge as we were ""given access"".

The hotel is right next door to a flash shopping centre. About 2 blocks for the river eating district. Walking distance to China town and little India or $7 by taxi. I loved the place.

Due to flight times we checked in at 9 pm ( check in time is from 2 pm ) we were told to take a seat while someone checks to see if our room was ready. Once it was we went up to our room to find it was dirty, and so old, like it hadn't been updated for 40 years. We promptly said this is unacceptable so they moved us to another room. This room was equally old with curtains falling of the rail, wall coverings falling of the walls and stains on the carpet. The room was bigger but this was the only plus to the move. The beds are the hardest I have ever slept in. It was like sleeping on the floor for 3 nights. The hotel photos are obviously so very old.

The restaurant is spacious and the buffet is nicely set out with name tags of dishes clearly displayed.

Great location close to food, transport and shopping. Staff did a good job in all aspects, even when dealing with some very rude and ignorant patrons. Friendly, and helpful. The hotel is across the board just average, especially for the money it cost to stay. The lobby and shared areas were nice enough but there must be a difference in the rooms standard. I stayed in a premier room which is not the cheap room. It was tired and dated, the bed was very hard. Seemed to be missing basic amenities, items broken. And the bathroom was one of the worst I have ever seen. Not only was it tiny, could hardly move or shut the door, but it was moldy, dirty, cracked and broken.

The breakfast spread at level 5 was great too. The only downside of our stay was the hotel's room door.
