The St. Regis Singapore,Extremely irresponsible and dishonest over excess charges,"I feel really sorry that I have to write this review as I have stayed at your amazing property multiple times and it has been nothing less than perfect before this extremely disappointing incident. In March 2023, I was billed for 2 nights after a 1-night stay. Since then, I have called the hotel at least 5 times. Each time, I was assured that I would receive a refund of the overcharge in a few days. A week or two would fly by without me receiving anything and I would call for an update, only to have to repeat my entire story to a different member of the staff. It has been almost 6 weeks since the incident, and I have yet to get any response from any of the 5 different staff members that promised to follow up.

The St. Regis Singapore,The best stay in this trip,"We've visited many hotels that tell us that they are 5* but this is the one of the hotels which also really feels like that. Location wise, it is not exactly in the middle of where the shopping places are. I rather take the place one block off which means that the hotel is decently well situated but still quiet. Service was as expected from the StRegis name. I won't say the best, and improvements can always be there. Most staff are helpful, gracious and welcoming. But the best were the doormen. Rooms are large compared to many other places even starting from the standard offering. There is no need to have a larger one for an extra price. Butler service is something which makes you feel special and they are quite fast. As a member I should get an upgrade.

The St. Regis Singapore,its a shylokian and Heartless hotel,"This is one of the most heartless hotel i have visited where they treat their ""Guests"" as objects. Absolutely contrary to their moto, the Innkeepers at the St Regis Singapore have lost the fundamentals of ""Hospitality"". There are several reasons why one should choose plethora of hotel nearby and not the St Regis at Singapore: 1) Its at a very uncomfortable distance. The minimum one way walk is about 1.1-1.2 Kms to reach anywhere. That distance is such that all modes of transport are uncomfortable (unless ofcourse you have a chauffer driven car at your disposal). The walk is enjoyable once but if you have to do it 2-3 times daily, it becomes a punishment. As you go towards the orchard road, several several choices open up and ""perhaps"" they might be little hospitable too! 2)",1 out of 5,May 2023,5.0 of 5 stars,#60 of 373 hotels in Singapore,-0.01536458333333334,0.4583333333333333,49.231770833333336,45.83333333333333,1.536458333333334,Location

At that point we called the duty manager to look into it. The duty manager apologised that the order was not processed at all!

The menu options are intentionally curated and the dishes we were served were exquisite. We ordered the beef tartare, ribeye, tenderloin, sides of mash and spinach, and tiramisu for dessert. If considering dessert, the deconstructed tiramisu is definitely worth a try. Our recent meal at the Astor Grill demonstrated that luxury has survived the pandemic at the St Regis. We were treated to an experience of quiet classy elegance that surpassed my past experiences as an in-house guest of the hotel.

After 15 minutes I got up and asked again....finally showed up. Then I ordered eggs, same problem. I reminded them and waited another 10 and decided to leave (we were now running late). At check out the front desk called to see if our bags were ready, they were so we left them and went to the lobby to meet them and our car and the bags never showed. Again, I needed to go inside and ask again. Lovely hotel and lovely people....I think the service needs a bit of shoring up but other than that, we",4 out of 5,September 2023,5.0 of 5 stars,#60 of 373 hotels in Singapore,0.19031084656084654,0.5014550264550265,59.51554232804233,50.145502645502646,19.031084656084655,Services

The room we had looked over the city towards the Botanical Gardens, huge windows but still very very quiet.

With its marble-clad bathroom, high windows and ornate furnishings (although I did notice some peeling furniture — aka the lamp drawer next to the living room couch), I don’t really have many complains with the look of the suite. However, the one thing that ruined it for me was the toilet itself which produced a highly audible “rush of water” sound that never ceased.

Our first night we got no sleep as there was excessive in room party noise from adjoining rooms whom were from a wedding party and despite me calling for someone to ask them to stop, it didn’t stop until some 4-5jours later.

Staff from brasseries running between the restaurant and lounge. Yan shuo from breakfast team very attentive and patience to attend every guests despite busy morning. Room is spacious, and the bed is comfortable. Love the bathtub and the double sink which is perfect for me and my husband. Pool is quiet and easy to get sun. Downside is they don’t serve any drinks and food. The staff in black jacket told us to order food from the lobby bar. Room come with butler service.

The St. Regis Singapore,Mind-blowing wedding service by Christine Wang!,"Christine Wang, Senior Events manager - Wedding, is one of the true unsung heroines of our wedding day and instrumental to its great success! We cannot thank her enough for all the help she provided from start to finish. What surprised us was her readiness and willingness to go the extra mile for her clients. 😮 For example, on our first meeting (7 months before the wedding) she was already helping us brainstorm quality vendors and ideas for our wedding, even without us asking. We later decided on a Disney fairytale wedding with the theme as <The Right Time>. Down the road we had a multitude of requests, but she met them all with grace. We recalled one incident where we had an idea for cake design, and she carried the dummy cake (that’s like a person’s height) all the way to",5 out of 5,October 2022,5.0 of 5 stars,#60 of 373 hotels in Singapore,0.200515873015873,0.40579365079365076,60.025793650793645,40.579365079365076,20.0515873015873,Services
The St. Regis Singapore,A (significant) drop in standard,"We had booked a suite room for 3 nights. It wasn’t ready upon check-in, which was a surprise but we could accept. However, what was unprofessional in the hospitality industry is how my husband had to call TWICE to see if the room was ready within the next 90 minutes. And no, the room wasn’t ready. Neither were we informed that it was. We just went out till 8pm+. Next, at the breakfast. The manager was wearing a frown on her face the whole time — a stark contrast to the smiling faces of the managers who were very warm, patient and yes, hospitable, in our previous stays. “Thank you. Please. Welcome.” weren’t part of her vocabulary. For an elegant hotel as St Regis, this attitude is unbefitting. Having paid SGD5600+, I would say this amount could be better spent in other hotels",2 out of 5,November 2022,5.0 of 5 stars,#60 of 373 hotels in Singapore,0.1458888888888889,0.48144444444444445,57.29444444444445,48.144444444444446,14.58888888888889,Services

The St. Regis Singapore,A lovely hotel I would rate 4.5 if there was that category,"We had a wonderful 4 day stay at this hotel. Check-in was slow and more staff should have been called to move the process along. When we went up to our room there was a line of 6 or 7 guests. The front desk does check-in and also serves as the concierge. The hotel was crowded on the weekend but it did not affect our stay. The breakfast buffet was plentiful and good. Our king sized room was large with an entryway area, 2 sofas and a desk and chair. The bed was comfortable. Towels were nice. We could have used a dresser with drawers but the closet had some shelves. The nightstands could have used some universal plugs but the desk had the universal plugs. Each nightstand had controls labeling all of the lights and the curtains. That was wonderful.

The St. Regis Singapore,"Great hotel, nicely located","The lobby is super impressive on arrival, and the experience is retained through to the beautiful rooms. There is an ambience of class and luxury to the hotel. There is a really nice bar (astor) in the hotel serving top notch cocktails. The pool whilst on a low floor had a lovely secluded feel and was never vaguely busy during our stay. The room itself was well appointed with a super comfy bed. The bathroom was not cleaned in a couple of obvious places when we arrived, which for the £400 per night price tag is not acceptable. But the problem was swiftly rectified and there was no repeat. The location is nice as it is slightly set away from the hectic orchard road but is just a short walk to the MRT which you use to get around all of singapore pretty much.

Treatment of all guests as VIP and providing personalised encounters for them. Was utterly surprised to receive a hand written welcome note from the General Manager, Mr Allen. Was treated with first class service from our butler Mr Kumar Pakirisamy, who took care of us personally during our stay and remembered our special occasions and needs.

The St. Regis Singapore,Truly wonderful,"Loved every minute of our short break — the room was so comfortable (Bose surround sound speakers and the fluffiest pillows), the service at the hotel was impeccable and we enjoyed our mini-art tour with Wilbur very much.
