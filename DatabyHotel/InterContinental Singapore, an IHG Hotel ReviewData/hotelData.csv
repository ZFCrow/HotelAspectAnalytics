What the stuff did not know is that my family stays in hotels twice yearly as a short getaway and other than this one ,we always stay in suites and have so far no complains. They give us a late check out as we are dinning in the hotel but lock us out way before the time. Whats worst was there was no apology but the attitute that it is our right. Had we known we would not have our lunch there before we leave. It is not as though we have no options. They sent letter to say that their motto is to exceed customers expectation.

Although the wedding coordinator we initially signed with left halfway, it was a blessing we were subsequently assigned to Sherlyn. She was wonderful and though it must have been difficult because she was not privy to the initial discussions we had with the previous wedding coordinator, she always tried her best to honour what was promised by the previous coordinator and she always took the effort to check first and find out instead of outright telling us no from the start.

"InterContinental Singapore, an IHG Hotel",Disappointing,"My experience at this hotel was disappointing. The lobby area is nice, but once I got closer to my room, I was struck by how dated and worn everything was. The carpet was frayed and faded, and the smell in the hallways was musty. When I checked in, I was told I had two free dinners. But I wasn‚Äôt informed which restaurant offered the free dinners. When I found out which specific restaurant I needed to eat at to get the free meal, I got a reservation and ate dinner. I later found out only certain meals were free and I had to tell the waitress in advance to receive the free meal. Despite having two conversations with two different staff in advance of my meal, I was not informed of this stipulation. Obviously, this would have been good to know ahead of time.

"InterContinental Singapore, an IHG Hotel",Good hotel w nice service close to shops- maybe lacking any Wow factor,To preface the review I stayed just before the Grand Prix so the hotel was completely full. As a Diamond Ambassador normally used to getting a nice room and with the hotel full got a regular room on a higher floor. What was nice is they did try and i understood as we were there for just one night they wanted to look after guests staying longer. Room was clean and nicely decorated but nothing especially stood out. View honestly was just over a shopping mall so being higher or lower made no difference. Bathroom again nice but nothing extra special. The best part of the hotel was the breakfast which although packed the hotel had organized well. Amazing variety of cuisines and excellent number of servers. Room itself felt special and is used for lunch and dinner The common,4 out of 5,September 2023,5.0 of 5 stars,#7 of 372 hotels in Singapore,0.3919501133786848,0.6842752485609628,69.59750566893423,68.42752485609628,39.19501133786848,General

The room was clearly showcasing the history of the place and the Singapore culture & architecture.

The check in was fine and the room was spacious with a very comfortable bed. The service was great too however, the only downside is that the room was quiet a distance from the entrance so when you come back tired, you had a bit of a walk before you could actually get to your room and relax. The other downside which in my opinion needs great improvement is the damp smell in the corridors with the dirty carpet needing change.

We did not eat dinner in the hotel or use any other services, but overall I would recommend this IHG hotel for business or leisure stay. The lack of city views would mean me choosing another option if I visit Singapore again, but that does detract from the fact the hotel is in a great location and offers 5* services.

The loung in the lobby is a great place to have a drink. The bar is decorated very well and takes you into something from a movie. They have every alcohol you could possibly want. The room was amazing and everything about it was 5 stars. We have a junior suite for our stay. The pool is huge and has many places to sun bathe.

We particularly liked the heritage trail (Sat 4 to 6pm) which was complimentary. Our guide Catherine from the Singapore Tourism Board was entertaining and humorous. I would highly recommend Singaporeans to go for the heritage trail as Catherine offered information which we never knew! We had access to the club lounge and were there for the afternoon tea (230pm to 5pm) and evening cocktails and canap√©s (6pm to 8pm). The afternoon tea was average but the evening cocktails and canap√©s were good. If you have time for only one session, opt for the evening cocktails. Premier Suite was of good size.

"InterContinental Singapore, an IHG Hotel",Poor ‚ÄòFamily First‚Äô staycation,We did the ‚Äòfamily first‚Äô staycation package at intercontinental on 28 Dec. I‚Äôd like to think that maybe IHG was experiencing peak period but it wasn‚Äôt exactly a good staycation (compared to the 3 others we have done). No complaints about the room but service / food quality really needs improvement. 1. Repeated reminders about kids bed - checked in at 1pm and It took us 4 reminder calls at different intervals for the bed to finally arrive close to 6pm. At the last call I was told the bed was already sent to the room an hour ago but we were in the room the whole time and nobody came. It was only after I ended the call the bed arrived. The bed came but not pillow which they had to make another trip again. 2. There was suppose to be kids and family amenities.

That really means I do pay a lot of attention to putting preference on IHG , a brand that I love to maintain my status. For the most part, it has been excellent as I gained the recognition and attention as per member benefit wherever I travel globally. However, this recent stay at the Intercon Singapore made me think twice if I would switch loyalty to another brand because so far it has been a very good experience with that other brand. Sad to say with this recent stay, I am really disappointed and frustrated, almost verging on anger.

"InterContinental Singapore, an IHG Hotel",The staff make all the difference.,"Let me start off by saying that this isn‚Äôt the ideal time for international travel due to COVID but more importantly, the extraordinary lengths that some countries go to when imposing restrictions to protect their citizens. However, this isn‚Äôt the forum for those challenges, this is about the hotel. We regularly stay at the Grand Stanford in TST Hong Kong, but of course we haven‚Äôt been for a couple of years. As we were finally able to visit family in Singapore, we thought we might experience a hotel from the IHG group which we hoped would meet the standard we enjoyed at the GS in Hong Kong. The Intercontinental in Singapore isn‚Äôt anywhere in the same league as the Grand Stanford.

We had nice big family room with a view. Beds were comfortable and room was clean and bright. Plenty of complimentary water was provided each day. We had lunch in the hotel on the day we arrived. The service was slow but the meal was fine. The location is excellent for tourists, right on top of a shopping mall and a short walk to Raffles. There is a bus stop across the road, and the tourist bus stops there. There are plenty of restaurants nearby but the MTS is also very close so you can get pretty much anywhere. Taxis to and from the airport were inexpensive.",4 out of 5,September 2022,5.0 of 5 stars,#5 of 372 hotels in Singapore,0.3721693121693122,0.6158730158730159,68.60846560846561,61.58730158730159,37.21693121693122,Services
"InterContinental Singapore, an IHG Hotel",Great stay,"Great hotel and staff. Getting access to the Club is a must there, for great breakfast and snacks throughout the day. The pool could be bigger, the water isn't particularly warm in the spa and the floor there is quite slippery. That would be the only downside to the hotel.",5 out of 5,September 2022,5.0 of 5 stars,#5 of 372 hotels in Singapore,0.44000000000000006,0.72,72.0,72.0,44.00000000000001,Amenities
