Holiday Inn Singapore Orchard City Centre,Fantastic stay,"We had a fantastic stay here. Staff were all very friendly. Breakfast was definitely a highlight every day and I’m missing it already. The kids loved the pool and it was never busy. The gym and change rooms were also very handy. My daughter hurt herself one night at the pool and when I rang for some Band-Aids they sent someone up to check on her, cleaned her foot and gave us some extra supplies for later. It was very appreciated. A few times we were only given three towels instead of four but they alway sent an extra up when asked. We did somehow lose a swimsuit. We think perhaps it was scooped up with the towels as it was in the bathroom. Not a huge issue though.

Holiday Inn Singapore Orchard City Centre,Struggle to fault,"Have stayed here on more than one occasion and if I had to describe it in one word I would say ""predictable"", in a good way (actual stay was Nov, 2015)! The check-in staff are always friendly and process straightforward. Rooms have always been clean and are well-sized by Singapore standards. Breakfast spread is not bad - it's not the broadest selection you'll ever find, but you won't go wanting. The Executive Lounge is fairly low-key, but was great for us with young children for their afternoon snack. After a morning of entertainment and running around, ducking in here around 3-4 pm and filling the kids up with a few sandwiches / pastries kept them going until dinner time (and us too!).

The large well appointed fourth floor room with two comfortable double beds was a relaxing oasis for the three of us to reside in. Had a view of a “highway” and some of the city skyline. Nice bathroom and high pressure shower. The TV had several channels with fuzzy pictures - maintenance guy told me it was due to an external antenna which was “out of the hotel’s control” ? Buffet breakfast was tasty and had a selection of foods to suit international tastes. Tried the gym but unfortunately did not jump into the inviting swimming pool...

The toiletries were not replenished. Even the coffee and tea bags were not there the next day. I had to call housekeeping several times to replenish them.

Holiday Inn Singapore Orchard City Centre,Good location and helpful staff,We stayed for two nights before joining a cruise. The hotel smells lovely when you walk in and is elegant and comfortable. The staff are very helpful. The room was lovely with two double beds. They have a happy hour in the bar between 5 and 7pm. We found it a great situation as it was near the MRT which is so convenient for getting around. Just outside the entrance is Cuppage Plaza which is a Japanese oriented bar/restaurant parade. The bars are open till 4 am so you can always get a late night drink on the way back to the hotel. Not cheap though. The Holiday Inn were kind enough to store our luggage for a whole day a week later when we had an 8am ship embarkation and an 11.15 pm flight.

Holiday Inn Singapore Orchard City Centre,Deteriorating Standards—scant sensitivity to customer & service excellence,"Been a regular guest at the Holiday Inn Orchard City Center for the past over 10 years. Off late have been disappointed at the consistently degenerating maintenance , service & delivery standards at this property. Over the past 3 stays undertaken in 3 months I have had consistent delays in “Check in” and “Check out” process at the hotel. Despite providing feedback in each occasion , I see no improvement in delivery and service standards. The Reception desk is more often than not understaffed or manned by junior in-experienced associates who seem to take ages to close a transaction. In most cases the hardware/printer or system software is blamed for the delay. Hotel upkeep and Room standards have also been deteriorating with some rooms having a rather foul smell.

They have a concierge who can assist you to know about the city however, note that if they say that something is close by, it is better to add some extra margin because I realized that the places are not very close as they usually say if you walk. I book a taxi very early morning and it was there on time. This booking was requested the night before. The hotel has a good beach also. The staff at the Restorant do a good job to accommodate the guests since the size of the same is not big. If you want to buy ok a hotel mainly to have a good rest so this is a good place since it has no many things to do during the daytime.

Holiday Inn Singapore Orchard City Centre,Great Stay but horrible Executive Lounge Access,I always stay at this hotel. The staff and the hotel is made really well and also I had no issues with the room except “ the aircondition” is always a issue. I do advice the manager and team to please check the airconditions before guests check in to avoid the hassel for customers. Rooms- Excellent beds and etc. I disliked the attitude of the staff at executive lounge. I find the lounge staff to not be friendly and I also felt the food was very cold from breakfast to snacks. ( variety needs to be improved). Egg Station- takes for ever to get your food( for breakfast) despite thinking its Singapore you would expect better service). Evening snacks- is so oily and oil is dripping all over. The variety is very bad compare to Hong Kong and Bangkok.

Holiday Inn Singapore Orchard City Centre,Could have been different...,Had to do a quick 1 day layover before my next flight and decided to hang around Orchard Road for convenience. Holiday Inn was decently priced and i was impressed with the service and room upon checking in. However the worst happened overnight when I woke up the next morning to a bathroom floor of literally 'toilet waste' caused by a back-flow from failed/blocked piping. I was in a rush to get to the airport so had to scramble around that to take a shower and checked out. However the little saving grace of this horrible experience was that the front desk reception and night manager's take on the issue upon checking out. A free taxi ride to the airport was offered and another apologetic email follow up later.,3 out of 5,June 2018,4.0 of 5 stars,#43 of 372 hotels in Singapore,-0.04340277777777778,0.4555555555555555,47.82986111111111,45.55555555555555,4.340277777777779,Services

Holiday Inn Singapore Orchard City Centre,"Mixed Reviews, Poor Service, Mis-Managed Property","Well !! I have completely mixed reviews about my recent stay at Holiday Inn Singapore Orchard City Centre (30/05/18 - 4/06/18) I am rather confused as to how should I be rating my experience. So, let me start off with my check in ! I was greeted by Chaw at the front desk. Very kind and gentle. While she was checking me in, I politely asked her if there is a possibility and feasibility for a complimentary upgrade to which she replied yes offcourse I am upgrading you to the executive room instead of the premium room you had booked. Happy and excited I said thank you, took the keys and went to the room. As we walked inside the room, we found it to be an extremely small room and not upto our expectations, so I decided to call the front desk to check if this was the uograded room.",2 out of 5,June 2018,4.0 of 5 stars,#43 of 372 hotels in Singapore,0.18944444444444444,0.6277777777777778,59.47222222222223,62.77777777777778,18.944444444444443,Services

Holiday Inn Singapore Orchard City Centre,Great customer service,"Stayed here in July 2018 with my husband and two children (3 and 7) for 10 nights. The room was of a good size with two large queen beds which was perfect for the wee ones to share. The room was pretty standard for Holiday Inn but what really set the place apart was the customer service. We ate breakfast at the hotel every morning and the buffet was excellent - good selection of continental and cooked choices, including eggs made to order. The kids were offered a hot chocolate every morning, which was a nice touch. The staff were cheerful and attentive even during busy periods. The rooftop pool was a great addition and it meant we could take a break from galavanting round the city on some afternoons.

Location is a real winner, it is slightly off the main Orchard Road is a less busy area, however it is perched just above/next to Cuppage Plaza which has alot of bars and eateries, so if your room is above this area, it may get noisy on weekend nights. Service is top notch, staff are all friendly and very helpful (but this is almost an expected requirement for any hotels 3 star or above).

The baby sitting service was great but unfortunately not available during the morning and early afternoon., maybe that could be looked at. The nanny my kids had was wonderful and my kids liked her.

The breakfast spread was more than adequate (although I did miss the mushrooms in this occasion), and I liked the new system with the eggs whereby one fills out a simple order checklist, they drop it off to the egg station, and the eggs find their way to your table. If I need to be at this end of town, it's definitely my first choice.

Holiday Inn Singapore Orchard City Centre,Troublesome experience,"My stay at this hotel in the month of September was so great that i had booked this once again for jan-19 stay. I had also informed their guest relationship officer Megan, i have been staying here on a regular basis. Unfortunately the stay this time was troublesome beginning with the check inn process.

Holiday Inn Singapore Orchard City Centre,"Wonderful Hotel, Great Deal!","I stayed one week at the Holiday Inn Singapore Orchard City Centre taking advantage of the ""Executive Club"" rate that included an extensive, tasty breakfast buffet; a ""snack"" which was actually lunch, and ""cocktail time"" which was for me dinner with drinks. The room was spacious and beautiful with 2 doubles, on the 7th floor, small frig and safe, away from elevators but convenient enough to get to the rooftop pool. The pool is large (for doing laps) with lovely flowering plants and comfy lounges and chairs–plenty of room, not many guests. The staff was extremely helpful and courteous. The hotel is a short walk to the closest MRT (clean, efficient subway) station (Somerset). This hotel contributed to an amazing visit to Singapore before I left on a 10-day cruise.",5 out of 5,February 2019,4.0 of 5 stars,#43 of 372 hotels in Singapore,0.2003968253968254,0.5607936507936507,60.019841269841265,56.079365079365076,20.03968253968254,Amenities
Holiday Inn Singapore Orchard City Centre,Good location but room is in need of renovation,"The location is great being next to Orchard Road and major shopping malls. However, the room is in need of dire renovation as the decor are mostly out of date and the TV / DVD player does not work with current age portable media. The bed feels a bit firmer than other IHG i.e. intercontinental which is surprising as Holiday Inn. The restaurant is suitable but over the 5 nights that I stayed, the food selection are the same every day.

Holiday Inn Singapore Orchard City Centre,"Great, friendly hotel but ripped off by IHG!","What really annoyed me before I even began my stay is that I paid about 15% more on the IHG website. I emailed the hotel with a screenshot of the price on hotels.com but their reply was around “prices are subject to vary…. this booking is not refundable”, etc. If anything, IHG should have been cheaper as they claim to be. Their “best price guarantee” doesn’t seem to hold or there’s enough fine print which makes the claim misleading. Also, the loyalty points are worth little. For example, by the end of my stay, I’d accrued 12 nights with Holiday Inn (over a 6 month period) but couldn’t redeem anything. On hotels.com, I’d have got a free night after 10 nights stay. Otherwise, this is an excellent hotel maintained to a high standard.

It's also a stone's throw from Orchard Road malls and the MRT. The staff are really helpful and there is a large seating area for chilling out as well as a passable bar for a hotel.

We wanted a reliable, comfortable hotel near to shopping and other Singapore attractions. We got just what we wanted.

Our check-in lady was very apologetic that she couldn’t provide an upgrade but solved the problem by offering the two of us with free breakfasts for all 3 mornings we would be there. Perfect and professional solution. I will admit that our room was a little small, rather dated and a bit dark. But it served it’s purpose. The breakfast was extremely good.

Money was taken out of my account a year before on which they agreed to let me use their facilities but they let me down as they couldn’t refund me back. The spa they claim that is downstairs isn’t even owned by hotel hence I couldn’t even use my extra credit of 295 Dollars. I requested them if I could use their car service to take me to excursions etc and amount to be deducted from my credit balance they simply refused. I was very disgusted and disappointed.

Holiday Inn Singapore Orchard City Centre,Great location but needs work on some important customer issues,"I've stayed before both for business and pleasure. I usually have nothing but compliments for this location as I stay in their group hotels worldwide. This time however, something was most certainly off. I had also prompted the location that this stay was for a milestone birthday (for my wife) and as a Spire Ambassador member, I expected something special. First, at check in, we did not receive the usual upgrade for their highest ranked members. OK, this occasionally happens die to overbooking but overbooking is not my problem. Always, previously in such cases, we at least get access to the club breakfast area and lounge. Not this time. Regardless of my loyalty status or the special occasion.

The location is great, food is outstanding, and all of the staff were friendly, helpful, polite, and a real pleasure to deal with. The pool and exercise room are really nice. My only complaints were these: 1. The hotel room (#514) had a strong musty, mildewy smell. I know that's more common in a tropical climate, but I've stayed in two other Singapore hotels (including a much cheaper one on this same trip) that didn't have that problem. 2. The alarm clock in the room was terrible! First time I've ever met a clock I couldn't figure out how to use. And when it went off (earlier than desired) it sounded like a fire alarm--very loud and obnoxious. Bad way to start the day! I had to unplug it. 3.

The rooms feel a little tired in the decoration, but that’s being a little picky really - it depends on what your expectations are. I’m happier with that than less substantially built modern style of hotels. Staff are really great, as is the breakfast (so many different food styles at the buffet from Indian to Malay to Japanese to continental to English).

We traveled with an infant and have already conveyed to hotel for an early check-in. When we reached hotel the staff offered us a lower category room for early check-in and told we can not change rooms and have to stay in lower category room for the complete period but when we told ""no we want our booked rooms"" he said to wait till 2 PM for check-in. After calling our travel agent and a long discussion they agreed to change our rooms to booked rooms on the next day if we take lower category room today or asked us to pay SGD 100 per room for getting our rooms on the same day itself.

The South Indian food is hopeless.The restaurant also is not fully geared to serve food when required . The ground floor lobby bar has only one lady attendant who seems to be overburdened.

We were very pleased, thank you very much! We were very happy with our room....the amenities provided and also with the housekeeping services. The room was provided with an ironing board and a steam iron as well, which to us was most convenient. Breakfast selection at the coffee house was good. The service provided by the staff was also good. I was happy to find out that their meat supplies came from Halal certified vendors, and they have separate kitchens for the non-Halal meats.

Holiday Inn Singapore Orchard City Centre,Indian at heart!!,"We chose the Holiday Inn at Cavenagh Road, near popular Orchard Road, primarily because of their in-house Indian restaurant Tandoor. Both my boys can't do without their Indian dal-chawal and roti-sabzi. And it was a good six-night long stay. I would say, it was as totally worth the money we paid. To begin with, the location of the hotel is awesome. You can just walk down to the ever-bustling Orchard Road. Replete with malls and all the big brands, it is a heaven for a shopaholic traveller. The next highlight of the stay was the food at Tandoor. Authentic flavours and very warm staff, I would especially like to mention both their Indian staff, they were very helpful. The only flipside that I can point out is the hotel building, it seems like a very old construction, hence feels",4 out of 5,July 2019,4.0 of 5 stars,#43 of 372 hotels in Singapore,0.28152777777777777,0.5236805555555556,64.07638888888889,52.36805555555556,28.152777777777775,Value

Holiday Inn Singapore Orchard City Centre,What an excellent place this is!,I had the pleasure of staying with my family at holiday inn in October 2019. It was a great experience right from the ease of check in to the location of the hotel. The staff is ever helpful to guide you. The rooms are big and I mean really big compared to Asian room standards. Love the fact that they have kept the international traveller in mind and installed plug points for us according to our country’s electrical sockets. That’s a big plus point in their favour. The location is so convenient being on Orchard Road. A minute away from all the big malls. There’s a Starbucks right behind it.

We haven't used any MRT because grab/taxi price for 4 was the same as for the MRT. The hotel is only little old but very well maintained. As an advantage for us the building is only 8 stories high and there is an very nice pool and jacuzzi on the rooftop (almost empty all the time we were there), The breakfast could be improved from my point of view but it was reasonable.

Holiday Inn Singapore Orchard City Centre,Great Location,"This was our 3 stay at the hotel in recent times. It's certainly consistent - staff are reasonably friendly for a city hotel. rooms are clean and comfortable, breakfast is good, pool area is ok but I'm convinced the water needs a better filtration system (looked a bit murky to me) and the location is terrific. However, the gym area and some of the equipment is laughable - I was attempting to use the pin loaded machine but had to leave as 2 other guys turned up. There simply wasn't enough room for 3 people.

However, it does not come without some flaws. The room first offered to us had a very strong moldy smell and we had to change rooms. Our new room was slightly better, though not entirely without smells or major signs of aging. The property needs a thorough renovation soon. With a few exceptions, service was not particularly friendly or warm, and some of the staff members seemed to need some extra training. Travelling with two small kids, we did not always feel welcome in the hotel's club lounge or lobby bar due to the attitude of the staff.

Ordered a extra Intercontinental breakfast together with the two high tea set and it took 40min to arrive.

Holiday Inn Singapore Orchard City Centre,Uncontactable and irresponsive behaviour,I booked two room for my family a month before and get charged right away. However when the Corona virus spread out i decided to email them that we will not able to make it to Singapore because we were afraid that our little son will get infected. I emailed the hotel twice to ask for free cancellation and some sympathy whether they can refund some amount for us but indeed i received no reply no call back from them. I even called them to check out and they promised to call me back but still no answer. I have paid lots of money for the room but what even worse were their attitude from a big brand hotel.

It was my husband’s first trip to Asia and we just wanted to relax and enjoy this fascinating place. I am not a fan of Holiday Inns, but the hotel is very well located, a few steps from Orchard Road and between two metro stations. It also offered a good deal for rooms with access to the Executive Lounge. We decided to give it a try and we are happy we did. First, my IHG Platinum status was recognized and we were upgraded to a junior suite. Second, the Executive Lounge is among the best I have ever been to in terms of service, quality of meals and availability of drinks.

Holiday Inn Singapore Orchard City Centre,Good hotel,"Stayed seven nights in an executive room with extra space and was very happy with just about everything. Excellent location just off Orchard Rd and an easy walk to nearby MRT. Surrounded by restaurants, food halls and shopping. Seems very popular with airline crew as saw them checking in and out every day. The Lounge itself wasn't open but we were well looked after for coffee, drinks and canapes by the staff in the lobby bar. My only criticism is the buffet breakfast is clearly aimed towards moslem clients with no pork anywhere, meaning a simple western breakfast of bacon and eggs couldn't be had (unless you enjoy turkey bacon, which I don't).

Holiday Inn Singapore Orchard City Centre,Does not meet the 5 star standards,"This is my 7th or 8th visit to Singapore. I have booked the stay for four nights at Holiday Inn Orchard Road city centre for first time but not a very pleasant experience. Instead of booking premier room, was allocated a room which is of lower category and do not even have a sofa/chair (only study chair was there) and was told as I have booked two rooms so if I want adjacent rooms this is the available option otherwise two rooms will be far away from each other. The room is of the premier category only and the size is small as it’s a corner room. However later on after a lot of hassles got shifted to room which was of premier category. I really wonder why the earlier room was kept in premier category. Pros. Only one - Location is excellent as on Orchard Road.

The cabinets are seriously filthy with spray marks all over them. The pool area is really run down and very old looking.

Do not stay here !",Checked into the property on 20th Aug'22 and am scheduled to stay here until 26th Aug---something that i am dreading. This property charges nearly $300+++ but is more like a poorly maintained 2 star property at a good location. I have already written a poor rating feedback against my stay in 2018 and despite assurances see that the hotel standards have only deteriorated. Few pointers (1) Lobby is shabby with mould visible around the air-conditioning ducts (refer photograph). (2) Poor implementation of Covid safety protocols : No sanitizers in the lift or other public areas on each floor. (3) Rooms smell of mould and have a poor upkeep standard.

Holiday Inn Singapore Orchard City Centre,Great Singapore city centre hotel,"Recently had a 3 night stay at the hotel and would definitely recommend it. We had a 'standard' family room (2 double beds) but this was a good quality and very clean. The rooftop pool was excellent and a nice way to cool down in the heat. Check in was good and very thorough. Breakfast very good including some decent Indian food selection. There is also a small gym next to the pool. The location is fantastic for exploring Singapore. It's a 2 minute walk to Orchard Road which has many shopping malls, and also 3 MRT stations nearby (Somerset is the closest within the mall opposite). Singapore is an expensive place to stay in and the hotel prices aren't ultra cheap but pretty reasonable for what you get.

Holiday Inn Singapore Orchard City Centre,Pleasant Staycation in City Center,"We booked a double standard room, and because of my IHG Diamond status, the friendly receptionist (Dorothea) kindly upgraded us to a lovely one bedroom suite. Our kids were loving the room so much that we extended our stay by another day vs initial plan. I don't need to talk much about the location of this hotel already, which is one of the biggest strength of this hotel. While it's a rather old hotel, it is quite well maintained. We experienced the very responsive housekeeping (which swiftly came when we needed anything). Similarly the staff at breakfast place also worked hard to clear tables and deliver orders to the tables. Breakfast menu item seems to be constant from day to day, so some variations would be good for improvement. Overall it was a very good staycation",5 out of 5,September 2023,4.0 of 5 stars,#43 of 372 hotels in Singapore,0.2628070175438597,0.41780701754385974,63.140350877192986,41.78070175438597,26.280701754385973,Value
Holiday Inn Singapore Orchard City Centre,Very satisfied experience,"Our stay was exceptional! The location was fantastic, with friendly and welcoming staff. The building and rooms were impressive, and the food selection in the Club Lounge was top-notch. What truly made our experience unforgettable was the genuine warmth with which we were greeted. We must give a special mention to Fiona and her team, who were super attentive during our visits to the lounge. Overall, we thoroughly enjoyed our stay.

Holiday Inn Singapore Orchard City Centre,Excellent mid-range choice,"Just returned from a 4 night stay - very happy with the whole experience. Spotless, comfortable room with excellent wifi, ice-cold air conditioning and a powerful walk-in shower. Rooms are well insulated from outside noise as well as sounds from other rooms. Breakfast buffet offers a wide range of choice and an egg chef for your omelettes, poachies and sunny sides up. And the hotel is well located, both for taxis to all the bits of Singapore you need to be in, and to a range of local shops (7/11, foot massage, tourist tat) and restaurants, so you won't need to wander far to find a bite to eat. Bonus kudos to the truly delightful Colin and Hairee from the concierge team, for whom nothing was too much trouble and were a smiling, exemplary example as the public face of the hotel.",5 out of 5,September 2023,4.0 of 5 stars,#43 of 372 hotels in Singapore,0.2625,0.5208333333333334,63.125,52.083333333333336,26.25,Amenities
Holiday Inn Singapore Orchard City Centre,Great location but needs a little TLC,I don’t like leaving any negatives because my wife and I enjoyed our stay and certainly would consider returning as we just did with a 4 night stay pre cruise and then a further 4 nights post cruise . Positives- fantastic position for all Orchard Road Shopping. Cupoage plaza restaurants behind. Diamond Elite status upgrade given . We further paid on the first 4 night stay to lounge access which was very peaceful with a good breakfast and evening food. Very friendly and efficient staff throughout . Price favourable against our stay last time we here at intercontinental. Negatives / the property is dated and in need of a a major upgrade. Dining room for breakfast has a great selection but room is very tired especially the tasteless floor.
