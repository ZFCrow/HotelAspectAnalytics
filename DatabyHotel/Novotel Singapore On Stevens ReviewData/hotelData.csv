Novotel Singapore On Stevens,"""Fantastic Stay with Exceptional Service and Convenient Location""","""We had a wonderful experience with the team's services and would highly recommend this place to everyone. We do have one request - it would be great if they could consider adding more diverse Indian breakfast options, as the current choices are limited. Additionally, we were extremely impressed with the helpfulness and support provided by the reception team, especially Gopi and Deepika. The location is very convenient, with a bus stop just 100 meters away and the metro station only 500 meters away. This place offers excellent connectivity as well. A stay here is sure to be enjoyable and memorable.""",5 out of 5,September 2023,4.0 of 5 stars,#38 of 372 hotels in Singapore,0.4125714285714286,0.6747830687830688,70.62857142857143,67.47830687830688,41.25714285714286,Services

Novotel Singapore On Stevens,"Great property, at a great price","Lots of amenities and the staff are friendly and helpful. Because of last-minute juggling of schedules, we had 3 different bookings. When we arrived, I asked the front desk staff (Deepika) to make sure we didn't have to change rooms over the course of the week. She did an amazing job in accommodation of my request. Also, we had to split part of the stay as business and part as pleasure. Again, the front desk staff was able to bill us accordingly.",5 out of 5,September 2023,4.0 of 5 stars,#38 of 372 hotels in Singapore,0.395,0.7027777777777777,69.75,70.27777777777777,39.5,Services
Novotel Singapore On Stevens,We love Novotel to our Acccor!,"My husband and I stayed at the Novotel for the Formula 1 and it was a very reasonable price for such a busy time of the year.
