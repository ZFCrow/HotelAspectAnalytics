Royal Plaza on Scotts,Pleasant and convenient,"Old and reliable establishment, recently renovated. Convenient location closed to Orchard Road shopping and eateries. Always friendly, the lobby staff and reception are most welcoming.Complimentary drinks in room are .appreciated but we only consume the mineral water. As senior citizens, we avoid the sugary drinks. We also skipped the buffets at the hotel as we avoid heavy meals. Perhaps the hotel can package a different and lighter meal program for seniors. so we can't give you an honest feedback on the food quality.But have to say, their advertisement for middle eastern food looks very enticing!

Royal Plaza on Scotts,Not as good as before,"I used to stay at this hotel quite often. One of the reasons was that there were several choices of free drinks provided in the roomâ€™s fridge (soft drinks, juices, and even Bir Bintang). I noticed that the owner of this hotel has changed, because some of the services that were previously provided are now reduced or even no longer provided, such as the free drinks, now only provided 2 small cups of juice; and 2 bottles of water on the first day, instead of 4 bottles on other days. When I arrived at the hotel and it was already 4 p.m., the room was not ready until 5 p.m., while the check in time should be at 2. The amenities were also lacking. Only 1 small bottle of shampoo (and also other toiletries) was provided on the first day, which was not enough to use for 2 persons.

Royal Plaza on Scotts,Not For Tourists!,Don't be fooled by the stunning entrance - the room although spacious and spotlessly clean lacked facilities. There was only hanging space for clothes and no drawer space so we basically lived out of our suitcase. Minimal tea and coffee in the room but only Coffeemate so had to go out and buy milk for tea. There was no Tourist information available for places to go and we had to ask for a map. The only Bar was a very small area on the 1st floor open from 6pm till 10pm so nowhere to sit and relax. I had asked on booking for a room on a low floor as I do not care for Lifts and preferred to use the stairs. On arrival I was taken through the kitchens to a back staircase to get to the 4th floor!

The conference was cancelled due to the coronavirus and as a medical professional i have been asked to stay in Australia to assist with the current situation.

Instead they took my money and said there was no reason I could still not come.

We always book a city hotel with pool to be able to relax in at the end of a day sightseeing. We were informed on the Friday before we travelled that the pool is currently closed. We were told this was for maintenance repairs but as this hotel is being used as an isolation hotel for travellers it felt that this was closed as a result of the hotel's policy regarding covid.
