Over the years, the percentages of Cleaniness, Amenities, Location, and Services have been increasing, while the General score has been fluctuating.

The Cleaniness score has greatly improved in 2020, and can be further improved by implementing better hygiene practices.

The Amenities score has declined in 2020, and can be improved by providing better quality amenities.

The Location score has been steadily increasing, and can be further improved to attract more customers.

The Services score has also been increasing steadily, and can be improved by providing better customer service.

Finally, the General score was highest in 2020 but needs to be monitored for further improvement. To do this, customer reviews and feedback should be monitored more closely."
