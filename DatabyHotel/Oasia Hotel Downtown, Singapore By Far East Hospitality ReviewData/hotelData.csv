"Oasia Hotel Downtown, Singapore By Far East Hospitality",Fantastic but some room for improvement,"Overall I though Oasia was a comfortable stay and had convenient amenities. I stayed in the club suite room, which was really nice; Included were complimentary drinks in the room to help keep you hydrated. The rooms were cleaned and fresh towels were provided daily. If you forget your toothbrush you've got nothing to worry about the hotel provided tootbrush and tooth paste (just incase) and the toiletries were really lovely to use especially as I have sensitive skin. The club breakfast options are really lovely but better, if you're not in a rush as there is typically a longer wait during busier times in the morning for breakfast, hence I opted for the buffet breakfast during the week and a club room breakfast on the weekend. It was nice to have the choice of two.

The room, although small, was exceptionally clean and well thought out. It was quiet, comfortable and everything we needed.

Whilst the hotel is ok, I’ve stayed in better budget hotels for a fraction of the price. The hotel is showing signs of wear and tear due to poor maintenance. The walls are bubbling, sealants failing and door handles (literally) falling off. The swimming pool is dirty and hasn’t seemed to be cleaned for the period I was there or at the times I used it. The air conditioning is noisy so had to turn it off at night time and the staff seemed uninterested when I reported it. The coffee machine at reception kept breaking down or required attention after a single use and again reported it to staff but seemed to be ignored.

What we couldn't understand was the check-in policy of separating 2 friends who checked in together to 2 different levels. The reception couldn't explain and eventually the duty manager, Wati, explained it is part of the SMM. I was wondering if my friend and I checked in separately, we may have been given the same level. After all we are dining at the club lounge daily! Sometimes policies are just not transparent or doesn't make sense. We stopped questioning so that Wati doesn't have to be too stressed.

"Oasia Hotel Downtown, Singapore By Far East Hospitality",February Staycation. Come back again? Probably not.,"Stayed 3D2N under a Far East promo, so considered quite a steal at $310 total for a Superior room. Package included late check out at 2pm and a box of chocolates (never saw any during the stay, but to be fair I didn't ask about it either). Arrived late on a Monday evening for check in, first room had a stale/musty smell so we had to change rooms. Second room had better A/C and ventilation. As other visitors have pointed out, the hotel doesn't provide bottled water and asks guests to consume tap water. I'm happy to support this initiative but the hotel would need to place more emphasis on ensuring their cups, glasses and kettle are properly cleaned.

The Club room guests are granted exclusive access to the Club lounge and Infinity Pool, both of which are located at Level 21. It is not an ‘Infinity’ pool per se but at least it is a long enough pool meant for swimming. Coffee at the Club lounge is surprisingly good. The free-flow evening alcoholic drinks from 6 to 8pm is inviting but lacking in alcohol content. Can’t complain since it is free! Not forgetting free 15-min massage, which is only available at the same time. The service at Club lounge is a bit slow, even during non-peak hours. However the staff made up for it with their friendly attitude and wits. A great shout out to Letitia, Xiao Wen, Karamjit and William for their relentless effort all night.

Firstly the room - it was compact, but well laid out. With the suite you have the advantage of two rooms, which was great for us. The bathroom was good, and there's a separate toilet room. The only slightly downside for us was the coridoor where the wardrobes are was really dark - we had to use the torch functions on our phone to see what we were doing. A very minor point on the room.

Joelle at the reception provided 5 star service (she was the highlight of my stay really). everyone i came into contact was so nice and pleasurable. The price point is reflected on the service and location of the hotel The rates are reasonable for Singapore so i feel like we cannot really expect much.

Can tell the room and facilities had much wear and tear. The luggage stand laminate is peeling, the toilet tile grouting points were alternating between black and white, there was a cobweb visible on the pantry door, and the window had stains on it. Guest instructions for wifi did not match the actual wifi name, although getting onto the network was quite intuitive. For general facilities, main reception timber floor had scratches, and some foot lamps along paths were crooked. On the floor we were on (18th), the rose gold wall near the guest elevators had stains along the corner. Good points: 1.Staff really shining through despite the hotel gaining age.

Service everywhere is extremely slow. At breakfast we ordered 2 cappuccinos and it took 25 minutes to arrive (they were not busy at the time), and when the coffee came only 1 came, despite us ordering 2. Another 15 min wait for a 2nd coffee meant we wasted 40 minutes for a coffee. And to top it off; they made ANOTHER 2 coffees for some reason.
