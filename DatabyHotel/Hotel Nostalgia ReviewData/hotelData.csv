Hotel Nostalgia,Would stay here again,"We like small hotels with a bit of character. This is in a good location for access to most tourist spots - we used Grab and the prices were very good. The room itself was not huge but thatâ€™s in the nature of a heritage building. Quiet, with very friendly and helpful staff. As a vegan the food offer was not for me but Prive just next door is brilliant for vegan food - reviewed separately.",5 out of 5,February 2020,4.0 of 5 stars,#1 of 2 boutique hotels in Singapore,0.3386111111111111,0.5737037037037038,66.93055555555556,57.37037037037038,33.86111111111111,Value
