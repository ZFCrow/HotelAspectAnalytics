York Hotel Singapore,Worst Staycation in Singapore,Stayed 1 night in Cabana room at B2 facing the pool. Everything in the room were old. Time to replace the mattress. DO TAKE NOTE THIS HOTEL STRICTLY DON'T ACCEPT GUESTS IN THE ROOM. Although COVID rules allowed maximum 5 pax in a room only 2 pax allowed to remained throughout the whole night. I ended up paid $70 for my cousin to stay till 10pm. Seriously such a desperate hotel to earn easily for visitor. Such unreasonable hotel. Please stay away this hotel if you want for staycation with visitors. There many plenty other hotels much better than this hotel in Singapore. This York hotel up the hill and can only accessible by vehicle unless you don't mind to walk 15 minutes from MRT. The front desk manager Narsha was very rude.

York Hotel Singapore,Overall Decent Experience but Somewhat Traumatised,"A quiet and cosy place tucked behind the hustle and bustle of town. Reminded me of American hotels with porcelain flooring, wide lobby, dim lights, and a long reception counter. Check-in was fuss-free and we were delighted to know that we were given a free upgrade to the family suite, however, we had an extra bed and didn't know what to do with it as it was just the two of us HAHA so we ended up using it as a bed to sit on for when we returned from outdoors (when we did not want to shower yet). After checking in, we quickly unpacked and I called the reception to enquire where the hairdryer was. When the staff mentioned it was in a drawer, I opened the next nearest of drawers to me (the bedside table), and to my absolute horror, found a used condom along with a torn Durex",3 out of 5,April 2021,4.0 of 5 stars,#119 of 372 hotels in Singapore,0.1064102564102563,0.4333333333333333,55.320512820512825,43.333333333333336,10.64102564102564,General

The room is a bit on the ""old"" side, but it's still relatively clean. I'm not sure if the price is competitive or we just came on a peak season, but that's the only reason why I didn't rate this a 5-star. The location is not bad too, walking distance to Orchard Road.

They don't have king bed size on superior room. The breakfast have a lot of options but the taste is not too great in my opinion, they even serves spaghetti that morning, which i don't think is suitable for breakfast.

York Hotel Singapore,Singapore is Beautiful!!,We stopped in Singapore for 3 nights and stayed at the York Hotel from 2/18 - 2/21/17. The hotel is decent but could use some upgrades. It not having a lobby bar removes liveliness we saw at other hotels. The room was clean but needed some more art on the wall which would have made it seem less cold. The complimentary breakfast was excellent each morning. The staff was friendly & the location convenient to high end shopping and great dining.

York Hotel Singapore,Great stay,"I booked superior triple for me and my parents at York Hotel because it's near Mount Elizabeth Hospital. The staff upgraded our room to family room upon check in. It was really spacious. On the next day, I broke my shoes and asked the receptionist whether they have super glue. The staff told me that I could go back to my room while he is checking. Not long later, a maintenance staff come with a can of glue and some tools. Feels like going to a cobbler. Really grateful for the service. My dad commented the security guard in front of the lift could be more friendly though. On the other hotel my parents stayed previously, the staff helped to pressed the lift when he is near the lift and saw them walking towards there.

York Hotel Singapore,Nothing special,The York Hotel is pretty ordinary as hotels go in Singapore. The bed is comfortable but our bathroom was small and needing a renovation. The bath tub in particular is very cramped. It's a 3 star hotel in my view and slightly overpriced. (The breakfast was an outrageous $33 Singapore.) The only saving feature was the good size pool (good for laps) and the location (if you like Orchard Road shopping and eating). In my humble view there are much better options in the area.

York Hotel Singapore,Average,Booked York hotel thinking it's close to Orchard Road and Mount Elizabeth Medical Centre but it is actually quite a distance away... atleast a 15 min walk and it's a uphill walk. The rooms are average and could use a bit of refurbishment.. especially the carpets in the hallway. Toilets are rather small. The most annoying factor was that we had booked two rooms and were allocated the rooms on different floors. Your room key card gives you access only to your respective floor so to visit the rest of our party we needed to go to the bell desk and a hotel staff to come and use their key card for access. Sometimes this process took atlesst 15 min as the bell captains were also assisting other guest with their bags.

On arrival the foyer showed some promise and looked inviting. The receptionist was very polite and had told me that they were going to upgrade my booked room (most hotels do this to make you feel like your special). After checkin I proceeded to the my upgraded room and as soon I entered my mind immediately thought that if this was an upgrade what the heck was the original room standard? What disappointment overcame my mind. I was exhausted from my flight and had no energy left to go back and demand a change.

York Hotel Singapore,A bit tired but serviceable,"Recently spent 3 nights at the York Hotel while on holidays in Singapore. Here are a few of my thoughts. LOCATION This is located close to ‚Äòorchard road‚Äô which is a quite famous touristic shopping district. Although I appreciated the wide selection of foods available in the various food courts, I actually wasn‚Äôt impressed with Orchard road itself, which really just specializes in high end retail that you would never really buy unless you had more money than sense. Most of the tourist sites were near marina bay and this required at least 45 minutes of travel via the subway, with the closest station located around 1km from the hotel (Orchard station). It was a bit of an uphill walk. Alternatively a taxi to this area (not a bad option at night) was around 10 dollars for memory.",4 out of 5,May 2017,4.0 of 5 stars,#119 of 372 hotels in Singapore,0.1829411764705882,0.4180392156862746,59.147058823529406,41.80392156862746,18.294117647058822,Location
