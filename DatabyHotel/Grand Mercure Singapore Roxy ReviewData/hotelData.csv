Grand Mercure Singapore Roxy,A once great hotel but no more,"I’ve stayed at the Roxy since 2012, mainly for work but any family trips going through Singapore and I’ve always booked here. Over the course of 200 + nights the one major thing the Roxy can offer guests is the staff and location. The staff have always been excellent and remain so, the location (whilst a little out of the way) has everything you need. From 328 Katong Laksa to Sin Hoi Sai Eating house and multiple hawker stalls and malls within a 5 minute walk, you don’t need to go far. Unfortunately though that’s where it stops now! The Roxy was a dated hotel when I first arrived 11 years ago, since then the rooms have had little to no attention spent on them. Because of this the rooms are not great and if you’re going an Executive room just save your money.

Grand Mercure Singapore Roxy,Felt like a budget hotel,Post covid this was my first stay at Roxy. Prior to this I have been visiting since 2005. No water bottles at the hotel instead we are required to use the dispenser outside the room. The usual breakfast area was shut. So it was shifted to 4th floor and was very crowded and options were very limited. My room 406. Getting out of shower is dangerous as one might slip and fall due to extension of sliding door. Amenities have reduced. Common Body wash dispensers were provided. The body wash had exhausted and had informed the front desk but no one replenished it. AC was set to 22 deg it was very cold. The AC buttons weren’t functioning properly so had to switch it off but after a while it was very hot. Had complained at the front desk and next day it was set for 23 to 24 deg but it,2 out of 5,August 2023,4.0 of 5 stars,#111 of 373 hotels in Singapore,-0.1381904761904762,0.3929365079365079,43.09047619047619,39.29365079365079,13.819047619047623,Cleaniness

Grand Mercure Singapore Roxy,Nice New Hotel between the Airport and Singapore,"First the positives, this is a very attractive new hotel, everything is immaculate from the rooms to the stylish outdoor swimming pool area. All the staff we encountered were exceptional, especially the reception staff on both occasions we stayed there. The only things that let it down were the food and the airport shuttle bus. We had the breakfast buffet twice, the 1st time was very good but the 2nd time the bread and croissants were not fresh. We also ordered some food from the bar which was quite poor. The airport shuttle needs to be more frequent, it only runs every hour. They have a bizarre rule about having to go to a different level of the airport to get some stickers before boarding it, this is exhausting if you have just arrived from a long haul flight.

Grand Mercure Singapore Roxy,Excellent stay at the Mercure Roxy,"On the airport side of town, this hotel exceeded my expectations. We got off our cruise in the port and taxied over about 7:30 am, hoping to leave our luggage. We were warmly welcomed and the given all three of our booked rooms by 8:30 am!! The room was spacious and comfortable. There was a pool with laundry room on the 4 th floor, which was so convenient. Aside from the construction of the new underground, it was incredible! Right behind the hotel are numerous excellent restaurants and one of the best artisan ice cream spots I have ever been! A couple blocks down there is s temple, and colonial neighborhoods.

We were so impressed we decided to stay here again when we next returned to Singapore. We like the location - it's close to the airport, Parkway Parade shopping centre, historic Katong and the gastronomic delights of the East Coast. Very friendly and efficient staff too. I would recommend getting an executive room and getting access to the executive lounge. They serve (complimentary) a limited breakfast selection, all day snacks and soft drinks and have a free happy hour from 6pm to 8pm (nibbles and alcoholic drinks).

Grand Mercure Singapore Roxy,Great Hotel ... left field location,"One of my favourite destinations in Singapore, not so much for the location and non palatial presentation, but more that the staff are friendly, welcoming and obliging and the rest takes care of itself. The Club Lounge staff (Vivian, Joyce, Annamie, Jesly, Ryan) and support staff are excellent. Nothings a hassle and the view over the sea is pleasant for coffee and evening drinks alike. The location has plenty of shops and restaurants around the area without being a highly promoted destination. On this occasion I was particularly spoilt with a suite upgrade making it all the more enjoyable I extended on a few occasions. Great hotel given its left field location and age.

Fast checkin, and they even provided extrabed for my daughter, this was unexpected. Thanks Guys. the front office guy was very nice and helpfull. also they provide a Cellphone that we could use for free, so we didnt have to buy local simcard for internet, just used the phone hotspot. this was a nice touch also.

Grand Mercure Singapore Roxy,suite room,"We returned for another staycation after a year (not ten!) and took up the offer for a standby upgrade to a suite. We were given the same type of suite we stayed before, albeit at a lower floor. It's worth paying more for the extra space and lounge access. I don't drink alcohol so the happy hour does not apply to me. The food offerings at the lounge are also meagre and not worth spoiling your appetite for dinner later. However, I do enjoy the peace and being able to have a cuppa and rest my eyes on the lovely sea view from the 17th floor. I also noticed that cake is served during the lounge hour. Why not introduce an afternoon tea service and serve the cakes then? That way you can spread out lounge usage over a few more hours and cater to guests like me.

Grand Mercure Singapore Roxy,Holiday stay,"Very impressed with this hotel. The service was excellent and included a free drink on arrival, extended checkout to 3pm and access to a change room to refresh before our late night departure. We used the free transport bus to Changi airport which was appreciated. The hotel is also very close to a large shopping centre and within easy access of restaurants, the beach and buses to the city and surrounds. We found the bus route 36 to be the best as it follows a circle route from the airport to the city and back passing in front of the hotel.

It's on the east (airport) side of the city which is presumably why it is used by air crews. The area, Katong, is a nice strip with a mix of expatriate pubs and good local (i.e. Chinese, Malay & Indian) places to eat along East Coast and Joo Chiat roads. You can walk down to the beach (worth a look, just to see how Singaporeans relax) and even hire a bike. They claim there is a 20km jogging track too... The hotel is a good base for visiting the city though subway construction (which will probably go on for at least another year) makes crossing road and getting to the bus stops and shopping centre (and beach) a bit of a hassle at busy times.",4 out of 5,December 2018,4.0 of 5 stars,#111 of 373 hotels in Singapore,0.018287037037037008,0.4719907407407407,50.91435185185185,47.19907407407407,1.8287037037037008,Location

Grand Mercure Singapore Roxy,A great hotel. You will not be disappointed,When I visited this fine hotel in February it was my first Accor hotel since using them in Australia. They continue to maintain high standards. My stay on that occasion was only brief but enjoyable and I determined to return. I did so for a 3 night stay and was fortunate to be allocated a 17th (top) floor room with Clubroom access. The clubroom provided alcoholic beverages in the evening with hors d’oeuvres. Regular beverages are available all day in a tranquil setting I was also given a voucher for a free drink and went to the Breeze bar and stayed for a few pleasurable drinks in good company.

The rooms were big compared to most hotels in Singapore and that was a big plus for us. There were a couple of malls nearby but the main tourist hotspots were a little far away plus there was no metro nearby. Thankfully, there was a taxi stand at the hotel and a bus stand opposite the hotel which made travelling relatively easy. The staff was very very helpful.

Grand Mercure Singapore Roxy,Staycation in March 2018,"Booked 2 rooms so that my family and I could have a staycation from 12 March to 14 March 2018. As an Accor Gold member, one of my rooms was upgraded to a corner room. There was just a bit of extra space near the window and the other extra space all went into the bathroom so there is actually very little difference in the actual room size otherwise. As we enjoy evening canapes, we got rooms on the executive floor. The executive lounge was quiet and it was conducive for my daughter to do her own revision on the first afternoon. She did not join us for the rest of the staycation. While we got to enjoy a free flow of beverages the whole day long, it was the evening cocktail part that we were really looking forward to.

It is a bit overcrowded and food smell is all over the place as ventilation is either poor or completely unserviceable. I did like the lobby coffeeshop though. They got some sandwiches and fresh fruit salad ready to go. Dessert is also quite good. One note though is that Singapore is expensive when compared to overseas economies.

Grand Mercure Singapore Roxy,Decent hotel close to the airport,Firstly the positives.. the hotel is quite close the airport and they offer free shuttle services to and fro from airport. The rooms are comfortable but not exactly luxurious. What I found lacking was the breakfast option. Being a vegetarian and Indian there was not much option which was surprising considering Jet Airways staff stay there. I had to manage with cereals and Bread- Jam. But the plus is there is a mall just opposite the hotel where you get practically everything and a couple of really good restaurants behind.

Rooms given were clean n cosy. Only grouse was that there were some inconsiderate hotel guests who will go into the emergency exit smoke..and they are NOT suppose to do such things. The 2nd hand smoke will seep into our rooms. Such smoke caused the rooms to smell of cigarettes which as non smokers... we really dreaded the smell.

And I am not disappointed, I got a response immediately and they reserved the room for me and my family . I was looking for a 6 night accomdation and the hotel is fully booked but still Klaus Gottschalk (GM) ensures that we will not be disappointed and reserved a room for us.

The size of desert was decent including ice-cream ,cake and pudding. My husband is vegetarian so there was not many options for him. Luckily, we had an awesome chief Mr. Low Yong Seng.

My stay was only brief but enjoyable arriving at 10pm at night the receptionist Wilson not only found me my requested quiet room on a high floor- 1528 but on hearing that later in my trip I was to visit Bali he wrote a note for me listing all the “must see locations.” The room was located on the pool side away from any possible traffic noise I was given a voucher for a free drink and went to the Breez bar and stayed for a few pleasurable drinks in good company. The next morning after a quiet night’s sleep I was taken in the free shuttle bus to the airport. All to brief but I am returning in just over 2 weeks time.,4 out of 5,February 2018,4.0 of 5 stars,#111 of 373 hotels in Singapore,0.13941176470588235,0.5086274509803922,56.970588235294116,50.86274509803922,13.941176470588236,Location

The bathrooms had old fittings and the attempt at trying to update the bathrooms clearly didn’t work. It was just a mish mash of styles.

Grand Mercure Singapore Roxy,Great for one night stope over,Hotel - rated three to four star. Proximity to airport - great with their free shuttle (just go to transfer desk on arrival and they will tell you where to meet the shuttle). The shuttle takes a while as it goes to each of the four terminals but great way to relax after your long flight. Route into Singapore city is always relaxing with great flowers and gardens along city route. Hotel has road works in front at the moment. Rooms are OK size with usual complimentaries (which you pay for). Pool is OK size but cocktails/drinks are served in plastic glasses (fine if you are swimming but if you are dressed in decent clothing please serve in glass). Prices are average (Singapore is becoming very over priced for just another big international synthetic city).

Had used a plate with cutlery and instead of taking it room service had attempted to wash it but again horrible job at it. There are four pillows and all are super super soft.

Check in was relatively smooth, as was check out - efficient if not really that friendly. The lounge was okay, as was the pool area. Unfortunately, our room was not so great. We had a pool access room which ended up being tucked down a weird little alley, with no sunlight, which meant the room was very dark all of the time, it also smelt damp and musty and had significant amounts of mold on the ceiling and in the",3 out of 5,August 2017,4.0 of 5 stars,#111 of 373 hotels in Singapore,0.03456349206349206,0.5530109126984127,51.7281746031746,55.30109126984127,3.456349206349206,Location

Grand Mercure Singapore Roxy,"Neither so good, nor so bad!","We stayed in this hotel for 3 nights. The stay wasn't so comfortable, as nothing went smooth. I will list down the bad and good points. The not so good ones: 1. It started with the journey from airport. We had asked for the hotel's shuttle from airport and we were waiting at the spot for it. The shuttle arrived 15 mins before time, but the driver didn't allow us to get in till the scheduled time. We were standing and waiting infront of the van, and he was reading newspaper! Too much for the hospitality! 2. Anyways - when we reached hotel, there was a long queue of people for check in and out of their 4 counters, only 1 was open. so after a 9-10 hrs journey, we were again waiting to check in!

Grand Mercure Singapore Roxy,Nice One.,"Very convenient location. Behind the hotel there are many restaurants to satisfy anyone's taste buds. Across the road there are markets, shopping mall, anything you may need. There are many masseurs, nail attendees etc in the corridor through to the back of the hotel. So, so many to choose from. They are currently having a railway line being constructed at the front of the hotel which will go to the airport, so that's a bit of a bummer as the overpass which went directly from the hotel to the shopping mall is closed. So it means you have to take the stairs. If you don't mind stairs then you'll be right. But the location and hotel are both great. Restaurants in the hotel are a bit exxy but you are in Singapore!!

Grand Mercure Singapore Roxy,Great restaurants,"Generally, I enjoyed the staycation at Roxy - my 2nd in two months with Accor! My only complaint is that the bathroom did not have a hand held showers - must have been designed by a guy. There was also no make up mirror. I had a minor problem when I asked for an adaptor and the hotel didn't have one. My straightener, bought in the US, could not go into the socket and the technician had to come twice (he brought an adaptor with him finally). There's not enough tv channels , especially entertainment channels. Comparatively the front desk staff at Bugis were friendlier. The restaurants were very good in the hotel - totally great value.

Grand Mercure Singapore Roxy,Australian Travellers,"As a member of Accor we chose this hotel for our one day stay in Singapore approximately 2 years ago. The hotel is a short taxi ride from the airport with many small eateries, shops and fruit vendors across the road. The pool area is a relaxing environment. Room was very comfortable with a comfortable bed, clean with good linen and nicely appointed bathroom with amenities. We had dinner in the hotel restaurant and were promptly seated. When our meal arrived it was brought by a Robot and served by staff. Different and nice! Meal was very good too!

Grand Mercure Singapore Roxy,A once great hotel but no more,"I’ve stayed at the Roxy since 2012, mainly for work but any family trips going through Singapore and I’ve always booked here. Over the course of 200 + nights the one major thing the Roxy can offer guests is the staff and location. The staff have always been excellent and remain so, the location (whilst a little out of the way) has everything you need. From 328 Katong Laksa to Sin Hoi Sai Eating house and multiple hawker stalls and malls within a 5 minute walk, you don’t need to go far. Unfortunately though that’s where it stops now! The Roxy was a dated hotel when I first arrived 11 years ago, since then the rooms have had little to no attention spent on them. Because of this the rooms are not great and if you’re going an Executive room just save your money.

No water bottles at the hotel instead we are required to use the dispenser outside the room. The usual breakfast area was shut. So it was shifted to 4th floor and was very crowded and options were very limited. My room 406. Getting out of shower is dangerous as one might slip and fall due to extension of sliding door. Amenities have reduced. Common Body wash dispensers were provided. The body wash had exhausted and had informed the front desk but no one replenished it. AC was set to 22 deg it was very cold.

Grand Mercure Singapore Roxy,Very expensive and rubbish service,"I stayed here for one night. The cost, even though I booked 5 months in advance was extremely expensive, 206 SGD. I remember when I booked thinking it was expensive but I thought why not for a bit of luxury! First issue is the airport shuttle has stopped, price of taxi 25 dollars there and 16 back! For that you might as well stay at the Crowne Plaza and walk to the airport! I arrived at midnight and checked in. I was upgraded to the 17th floor, which is the Executive Floor. All good I thought. I was then given my free drink voucher. I asked where the bar was and it was closed! Nowhere at all to spend my free drink voucher. No free wine in room to recompense that either!

This superior level looked like the rooms were stuck in the communist era in the 80’s, dirty awful carpets, smelly pillows, hard beds, broken tiles, detached wallpaper, broken chairs, etc. I do not recommend it and will never book it again (not even to an Ibis Budget level).",2 out of 5,September 2022,4.0 of 5 stars,#111 of 373 hotels in Singapore,-0.0438852813852814,0.6419372294372295,47.805735930735935,64.19372294372295,4.388528138528141,Cleaniness
Grand Mercure Singapore Roxy,Most memorable wedding anniversary celebration,"We were upgraded to a business suite for this wedding anniversary celebration. The room service was excellent despite we kept calling for them to deliver items to our room on numerous occasions. They will always deliver with a smile. The restaurant managers, Jojo and Eddy were fabulous in serving us when we had our dinner at Jia Wei and Feast Roxy. They also provided us with very personalized service by giving us a complimentary champagne in one of the dinners. Subsequently, we requested for a change for our breakfast to be served in the room instead of having it in Feast Roxy, this was readily acceded to. In fact, they even got the chef to provide me with two customized breakfast sets to be served in our room for both my wife and I.

This time it appeared the hotel was completely stripping back services. We were told the Club Lounge was operational - it was to a degree - pushed into a small area in the main eating area, half a dozen uncomfortable chairs and tables. The snacks were dreadful, only broken crackers and tiny portions of cheese on one occasion. Drinks limited to 2 per person served somewhat reluctantly. So unfriendly we didnt even bother to use our freebies. On booking were informed the Club Lounge was opperational which is not the case. No welcome platter or welcoming letter in the room.

This was not communicated to me at check in. At check out, when I was presented with the breakfast bill, I was surprised to be told there is a difference in the price. So if you turn up at the restaurant, it is about $37 compared to $25 if you pay at counter beforehand. Why didn’t anyone say so?

Grand Mercure Singapore Roxy,"Decent hotel, Rude staff","Hotel is decent, cleanliness was maintained throughout the property. Hassle free checkin and checkout. Highly disappointed by the front desk staffs behaviour. There were two ladies at 9pm on front desk on 13th may 2022, Manisha just rolled her eyes the moment I approached her for help as my key card wasn’t working and the lady staff was very rude to me and talked very rudely to me which is not acceptable by someone who belongs to hospitality industry. I am not sure about her name (maybe Venice or asi). This made my experience sore.

Grand Mercure Singapore Roxy,"Old Suite, Mediocre Service","Stayed in one of the suites for two nights over the May Day and Hari Raya long weekend. Was rather disappointed with the condition of the room - worn out, had a smell and a old television that had a faulty wire. It has peeling wall paper and had a design that was stuck in the late 1990s or early 2000s. The doors were not sound-proof, so whenever anyone walked by and had conversations, you could hear them clearly. Service at breakfast and cocktail was also mediocre. It looks like the staff were overworked and were generally unhappy. It is certainly the first time I have been to a hotel that staff were not welcoming at all. It is the first and last time for me. The only saving grace was the late checkout at 3pm. However, we were eager to head home before that.",3 out of 5,May 2022,4.0 of 5 stars,#111 of 373 hotels in Singapore,-0.1061224489795918,0.5312925170068026,44.69387755102041,53.12925170068026,10.612244897959185,Services

We were welcomed by the hotel manager upon arrival, the rooms were upgraded to high floor with great view, offered free breakfast and evening snacks due to my platinum membership, offered complimentary roller bed, complimentary parking etc. The price of F&B is not at all pricy and is 'ordinary', e.g. a bowl of salad is just 5+ dollars.

Grand Mercure Singapore Roxy,Love this location and price !,"This is our 4th stay as platinum members We had rebooked for 3 nights initially, then with covid added another 2 and then another 1.

The noise was a little more than usual by the pool area but could not hear from the room. Swimming pool was great as usual - sun goes off at 4pm this time of year. It did get busy at times but plenty of sunbeds. Late checkout was brilliant too. Complimentary airport shuttle is a bonus albeit we arrived by a large taxi which cost us 25SGD.

If you are there on a Wednesday night they have a half priced smorgasbord including many seafood dishes. The food is delicious and at a very reasonable cost. The hotel also provide a free shuttle to and from the airport as well.

The thoughts that went into creating this surprise was simply beyond words. The staff at the reservation office, front desk, concierge and shuttle bus captains are all gems of the hotel too.

It begins with the driver of the Changi-shuttle bus, who welcomes you with 'can I help you with your luggage?' Then you arrive at the lobby where helpful people unload your luggage, show you the way to the counter and bring the luggage to the room. If you are disabled they have a wheelchair AND a cheerful staff member who happily pushes you to the room.

The hotel has been my regular visit in recent years. It's definitely value for money with big room size and free shuttle bus from airport to hotel.

Glad we did as the meal was very good over a few drinks. Great idea with the poolside bar and Bistro. Kadir did a great job of looking after us. Next morning, went and spoke to the concierge.

The hotel is very convenient to the airport with a complimentary shuttle bus on offer in both directions.

Located conveniently between the Airport & the city, and offering the great service of a hotel/airport shuttle, it was once again a good choice.

Access to the Executive Lounge was appreciated & service in there was friendly & professional.

We stayed for a week and found all the staff really kind and helpful. From the cleaner on level 9 to the doorman who helped us when we didn't have cash for a taxi.

Grand Mercure Singapore Roxy,Fine,"The grand mercure is located ik a really nice neighbourhood in Katong. Close to the East Coast Park and with lots of nice restaurants and foodcourts around. There are some beautiful streets with old shophouses behind the hotel. However, the mercure is. Ot as hip & trendy as the rest of the neighboorhood. The lobby looks uograded, so does the pool area. The room definitely not. It is functional but still has carpet on the floor, no coffemaker, bathtub with a showercurtain, very old showerhead. And one major issue, rooms are superhumid. Nothing dries in the rooms. Bathtowels and swimming stuff is still wet after a day and night of drying. We were here for a sailing regatta so come home with a lot if wet clothes.

Grand Mercure Singapore Roxy,"Great Staff, but the premises are getting tired","The Mercure Roxy suited our family of three just fine, based primarily on its location. The staff is professional, enthusiastic, and kind, but in my opinion, the premises are getting close to needing renovation. After our first day here, we needed to change rooms due to some unpleasant odors coming from who-knows-where. The front desk quickly located better rooms, and moved us, no questions asked. It feels like an airport hotel, with lots of air crews coming and going. There are frequent (free) shuttles to Changi Airport - very convenient. The buffet breakfast is good sized, but very main-stream.

Grand Mercure Singapore Roxy,Excellent service,"Stayed here twice over the past 2 months. The first time was in celebration of my daughter's 3-year-old birthday. I had requested for a small card with the words Happy Birthday just to wish her. The Front Office Team (special mention to Ditta) went above and beyond that to make a gorgeous hand-made card for her and also prepare a cake. Together with the Housekeeping team, they decorated the room so beautifully, making her day extra special and memorable! When we came back the second time, my daughter had remembered the little towel bunnies that were prepared the first time, so I made a request in the booking if she could have them again. When we entered the room, there were no bunnies and she was a little disappointed.

We arrived in a car organised by the hotel and were greeted at reception by a very nice young man who booked us in and we were then shown to the room on the Executive floor. The room was large and well maintained (NOT old and dim - they must have been in another hotel!!) We used the executive lounge for breakfast and nightly canapes and really enjoyed the view fro there across the harbour. On 2 nights we had dinner in the bistro on level 4 and the food was excellent - 1 meal was steak (yum) and the other spaghetti bolognese - delightful.

Breez Bistro Bar has a happy hour but I am suspicious that the glass size does change for this, and the price was higher than advertised, and no attempt to refund to look after the customer, just complained that management had not changed the advertised price when they were asked to.

Grand Mercure Singapore Roxy,"Great hotel, Great Location","Great hotel and a great location. During checkin we took advantage of the paying for the upgrade to the Executive Floor. This gave us access to the complimentary breakfast buffet, all day refreshments and nightly complimentary drinks and hors d’oeuvres in the Executive Lounge. The lounge also provided a great view of the ocean and some of the city skyline. There was also a great breakfast buffet downstairs. This buffet had a large selection of both Western and Asian selection. The hotel is located away from the downtown area, but with the great Singapore MRT system, you’re a bus ride or metro ride from anywhere you want to be. There are shopping malls, all kinds of restaurants and several food stands within easy walking distance of the hotel.

Reception kindly gave me a map of local sights; its easy to walk to the beach (watch out for the brief heavy rain showers though - caught me out!) and to the beautiful old Peranakan buildings.

Grand Mercure Singapore Roxy,Short Stay in Singapore,"A stay over two periods, but interesting to see the difference. The first time I took the opportunity to upgrade (at my cost) but it was not worth it (no real benefit for the upgrade), so opted not to for the second stay. Rooms are a little tired now and possibly need some work. Neighbours can be very noisy in the middle of the night, not the hotel's fault but shows the lack of sound proofing in the hotel. Breez Bistro Bar has a happy hour but I am suspicious that the glass size does change for this, and the price was higher than advertised, and no attempt to refund to look after the customer, just complained that management had not changed the advertised price when they were asked to.

The city is a short distance by taxi or Metro and the East Coast parkway a short walk. If you can, try and book the executive rooms. We had one on the 17th floor & the view from the executive lounge is great, whilst the breakfast & evening cocktail service is very relaxing.

Grand Mercure Singapore Roxy,Perfect for our purpose,"We only stayed one night and this hotel offered the best for us coming from the airport and going to a cruise ship. We took the free shuttle which was there exactly on time. Even though we arrived early it was no problem to check into our room straight away which was wonderful after 36 hours of traveling. It was also a nice surprise to get an upgrade. The big room had a king size bed and a chaise lounge in front of the huge windows. It also had a good size bathroom and everything was really comfortable. As the weather was very bad that day we just slept, drank tea and looked out of the window on the 16th floor.

Grand Mercure Singapore Roxy,Just ok,"I stayed at 3 hotels during my Singapore visit and while this hotel wasn’t bad, it my least favourite of the three. This is mostly due to the location. The area is under construction at the moment (certainly not the hotel’s fault) and while there is a bus stop nearby, there are no MRT stations within short walking distance. I also find that taxis had a hard time finding the place — overall, the location is inconvenient if you’re trying to do a lot of exploring/sightseeing. The room was spotless, although the decor is a bit old/dated compared to other Singapore hotels that I stayed in. The hotel has lots of decent snack and food options although they’re on the pricey side. The pool looked very nice, although I didn’t use it. The free airport shuttle is a good convenience.

Grand Mercure Singapore Roxy,"Pleasant stay, Helpful staff and Close to the Airport with Free Shuttle Service","Our stay at the Grand Mercure Singapore Roxy was for one night in the Deluxe Pool Side Room, this room is ideal if you prefer like to have direct access to the pool area, a perfect location for that swim and relaxation near poolside.

When you book your stay the hotel will provide the details for the shuttle bus meeting point at the airport and you will be transported from the airport to the hotel.

As I know they provide coin operated laundry, it saves me from bringing too many clothes. It costs $7 each for washing and drying and coins can be exchanged at reception. Plenty of good foods around if you don't opt for their breakfast. It has swimming pool and gym which I don't get to enjoyed.

Grand Mercure Singapore Roxy,Nice New Hotel between the Airport and Singapore,"First the positives, this is a very attractive new hotel, everything is immaculate from the rooms to the stylish outdoor swimming pool area. All the staff we encountered were exceptional, especially the reception staff on both occasions we stayed there. The only things that let it down were the food and the airport shuttle bus. We had the breakfast buffet twice, the 1st time was very good but the 2nd time the bread and croissants were not fresh. We also ordered some food from the bar which was quite poor. The airport shuttle needs to be more frequent, it only runs every hour. They have a bizarre rule about having to go to a different level of the airport to get some stickers before boarding it, this is exhausting if you have just arrived from a long haul flight.

However, I do enjoy the peace and being able to have a cuppa and rest my eyes on the lovely sea view from the 17th floor. I also noticed that cake is served during the lounge hour.

The hotel is also very close to a large shopping centre and within easy access of restaurants, the beach and buses to the city and surrounds.

You can walk down to the beach (worth a look, just to see how Singaporeans relax) and even hire a bike. They claim there is a 20km jogging track too...

We didnt use the hotels restaurants, gym or pool, but the gym showers were perfect to refresh ourselves before heading off for the long flight home late in the evening. Our room on the 17th floor was large and spacious, but quite close to the lifts so could be noisy at busy times (room 1701). The room had a Handy phone which was absolutely brilliant to help us make the most of our stay in the city. Free local and international calls, maps, guides, etc etc - all free!!!

Grand Mercure Singapore Roxy,A great hotel. You will not be disappointed,When I visited this fine hotel in February it was my first Accor hotel since using them in Australia. They continue to maintain high standards. My stay on that occasion was only brief but enjoyable and I determined to return. I did so for a 3 night stay and was fortunate to be allocated a 17th (top) floor room with Clubroom access. The clubroom provided alcoholic beverages in the evening with hors d’oeuvres. Regular beverages are available all day in a tranquil setting I was also given a voucher for a free drink and went to the Breeze bar and stayed for a few pleasurable drinks in good company. I stayed for 3 nights of peaceful sleep prior to joining a cruise.

The location of the hotel is never a problem, taxis are cheap and plentiful and the benefits of this hotel would still have me use it if it were miles from anywhere.

Grand Mercure Singapore Roxy,Good stay but overloaded breakfast,"Stayed there in February on a layover. Hotel is quite organized and rooms are super clean. Breakfast is served on the Mezzanine floor. It is a bit overcrowded and food smell is all over the place as ventilation is either poor or completely unserviceable. I did like the lobby coffeeshop though. They got some sandwiches and fresh fruit salad ready to go. Dessert is also quite good. One note though is that Singapore is expensive when compared to overseas economies.

Grand Mercure Singapore Roxy,Decent hotel close to the airport,Firstly the positives.. the hotel is quite close the airport and they offer free shuttle services to and fro from airport. The rooms are comfortable but not exactly luxurious. What I found lacking was the breakfast option. Being a vegetarian and Indian there was not much option which was surprising considering Jet Airways staff stay there. I had to manage with cereals and Bread- Jam. But the plus is there is a mall just opposite the hotel where you get practically everything and a couple of really good restaurants behind.

Rooms given were clean n cosy. Only grouse was that there were some inconsiderate hotel guests who will go into the emergency exit smoke..and they are NOT suppose to do such things. The 2nd hand smoke will seep into our rooms. Such smoke caused the rooms to smell of cigarettes which as non smokers... we really dreaded the smell.

Grand Mercure Singapore Roxy,Great staff,"I am writing this short review on the basis of my communication with the hotel. I will write a detailed one after my stay next week. I was looking for a hotel in Singapore as we planned a last minute trip. One of my friend Alan recently stayed at the Grand Mercure Singapore, Roxy. He praised so many good things about the hotel and the staff so I decided to contact the hotel directly. And I am not disappointed, I got a response immediately and they reserved the room for me and my family . I was looking for a 6 night accomdation and the hotel is fully booked but still Klaus Gottschalk (GM) ensures that we will not be disappointed and reserved a room for us. They even offered a free rollaway bed for my little girls.

The food was fresh and they had lots of options for meat including pork, beef ,lamb and chicken. They had sea food as well, but not as good as meat. The size of desert was decent including ice-cream ,cake and pudding. My husband is vegetarian so there was not many options for him. Luckily, we had an awesome chief Mr. Low Yong Seng. As soon as he heard our problem, he offered to prepare some separate vegetarian dishes for my hubby and it turned out to be wonderful.

I had forgotten to leave feedback from survey which was forwarded in time, which has since expired. Apologies to Klaus and the team there.

Toothbrushes included in room. Wasn't expecting that from a 4 star rated hotel. Buffet breakfast has a good selection of hot and cold food. Lots of local cuisine.

Grand Mercure Singapore Roxy,Disappointing,"This hotel was a huge disappointment especially having spent the first few days of my stay in Singapore at a neighbouring hotel. The rooms are dull, uninspiring, dark and dinghy. The hotel is supposed to have had a refurbishment but the hallways are dark and smell of damp and the chocolate brown carpets and walls don’t help. The furniture in the rooms are poor quality with lots scratches and chips. I didn’t feel comfortable walking barefoot in the bedroom. The bathrooms had old fittings and the attempt at trying to update the bathrooms clearly didn’t work. It was just a mish mash of styles. You take a shower at your own risk because you have to climb in and out of the bathtub to do this. Clearly old-style.

Only suggestion would be for evening drinks and canapés to start a little earlier so you can still head out for an early dinner.,4 out of 5,October 2017,4.0 of 5 stars,#111 of 373 hotels in Singapore,0.2424479166666666,0.50625,62.122395833333336,50.625,24.244791666666668,Services

Although we had arrived early we were immediately allocated an upgraded room. The room itself was very comfortable and scrupulously clean. Our first visit was for one night before joining a cruise next morning. We returned after the cruise to spend a further four nights attending the F1 Grand Prix. On this occasion we were given an Executive room on the 17th floor.

On arriving at the hotel to check in was shown into a large room with the rest of the group and had to join the queue. When we finally got to our turn we asked if we could get into our room as we were feeling rather unwell still. Was told it would be after 2pm, this was a 3 hour wait. They must have seen the look on our faces and said if we came in 30mins they would have a room for us. We went into the bar next door to sit and wait as it was quiet in there. Just as we sat down a very nice young gentlemen came to us and took us up to our room and said he hoped we would feel better soon.

It is a little out of town on the east coast, 10 mins from Changi Airport. Room was nice on the seaward side, 17th floor. Staff were helpful and polite. Breakfast in the main lounge was excellent.

Excellent hawker’s centre across the road and discovered another just up a bit near the government housing blocks which looked good.

Grand Mercure Singapore Roxy,Service could be a lot better,"Staying for business. Room is okay size wise given it's singapore. The mini fridge is tiny. Hardly fits anything. The room was made and found the cup they had left had disgusting marks at the bottom (as if not washed), and also had a lot of fluff inside cup so it was obvious they used a towel to wipe it (i hope it wasn't a dirty one). Had used a plate with cutlery and instead of taking it room service had attempted to wash it but again horrible job at it. There are four pillows and all are super super soft. Using two is too high, one is basically face on the bed. Buffet breakfast is good and a lot of varieties however not for anyone aiming gluten free. Few vegetarian dishes available though.

Great location with easy access to shopping centers, near public transportation like bus, MRT, Taxi and most importantly food.

Well appointed bathroom with good amenities made for a helpful stopover on the way through Singapore to Europe. The free shuttle to airport makes it easy to use as a transit stop and the surrounding area still lets you enjoy the best of Singapore without going into the city centre.

Grand Mercure Singapore Roxy,Great restaurants,"Generally, I enjoyed the staycation at Roxy - my 2nd in two months with Accor! My only complaint is that the bathroom did not have a hand held showers - must have been designed by a guy. There was also no make up mirror. I had a minor problem when I asked for an adaptor and the hotel didn't have one. My straightener, bought in the US, could not go into the socket and the technician had to come twice (he brought an adaptor with him finally). There's not enough tv channels , especially entertainment channels. Comparatively the front desk staff at Bugis were friendlier. The restaurants were very good in the hotel - totally great value. Feast@East buffet has a wide enough spread for those who like seafood and local cuisine - I'm more for quality than quantity so this was just right",4 out of 5,July 2017,4.0 of 5 stars,#111 of 373 hotels in Singapore,0.1697142857142856,0.5377142857142857,58.48571428571429,53.77142857142857,16.971428571428568,Cleaniness
