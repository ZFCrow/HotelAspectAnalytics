Naumi Hotel Singapore,Well appointed and great location,"We stayed at Naumi because of its proximity to Suntec, where we were hosting an event. What we didn't realize was how great it was to be between two lines of the MRT, as well as walking distance to the Raffles Hotel, tons of cool shops and restaurants, and a great little street market two blocks away on the weekend nights. I stayed for business but enjoyed the happy hour from 5 pm to 7 pm and the rooftop pool as well. The Naumi is a luxurious property without the luxurious price tag.

Naumi Hotel Singapore,Great experience!,"My husband booked a surprise stay for us. Been here but this time, we loved our stay! Very pleasant experience! Staff is great, really efficient and most importanly professional! Been here 4 months ago with my sister, but wasnt impressed at that time as it looked very chaotic at the front desk. They had asked us to sign the registration card again after we completed it few minutes ago, almost misplaced my sister’s ID too. There was a management staff, a lady with blonde like short hair who was screaming at a staff in the lobby. It looked like they haven’t been trained. The staff all seemed so tensed. But this time around, ambience of the lobby was more lively and feels more like 5 star. Staff seemed polite and hospitable. Great improvement!

Naumi Hotel Singapore,Quiet and Safe Area,"The Naumi is a great modern boutique hotel, next door to the famous Raffles Hotel, about a 5 min walk to Bugis shopping centre and markets and also next door to some amazing restaurants and a great gin bar.

Naumi Hotel Singapore,Awesome and Helpful Staff,"Room is great. Not high storey but pretty well maintained and was quite sound proof. In the morning, if not for the sound proof room, I would have been awakened by the loud cries of the baby who probably stayed next door (could hear a bit but weak enough to let me continue to sleep).

Naumi Hotel Singapore,Bad service and sloppy housekeeping,"The hotel is nicely decorated with art and the rooftop infinity pool is nice but the service is disappointing and housekeeping is bad, below the standard of a 5 star hotel.

I had been out from 9 am and found the room uncleaned when I returned at 9:30 pm on one day and 6 pm on another day. They didn’t clean my room until 5:30 pm an another day. They tried to tell me that they clean checking out rooms first but I’ve never had any housekeeping come so late or not at all at any other hotel.

Entry level rooms (we were just staying one night) were comfortable but compact so for longer stays you might want to upgrade. We had a baby in a cot and all his stuff so it was a bit tight for any more than a night or two. Breakfast is a light plated affair but there is an excellent Taco place next door for a brunch if that’s more your thing. Design is very cool and the downstairs bar has a buzzy feel at night. Extremely good value for money. Just a tip if you have questions or need help from reception prior to check in ensure you leave plenty of time as they were not able to get back to me before I checked in for my stay as I booked the day before.

Naumi Hotel Singapore,Our new favourite Singapore Hotel.,We have just spent 3 nights at the Naumi. This was our 5th visit to Singapore and each time we have stayed in a different hotel. I always look around for good value so we usually avoid the hign end priced places. We purchased a Luxury Escapes deal for the Naumi. Firstly the location was perfect. Right amongst the big names. Across the street from Raffles and the Marriot and within walking distance to many of our favourite areas including Hawker Centres and many other dining options. The rooms were very functional and the boutique hotel is decorated with lots of interesting artwork. The highlight of the hotel is undoubtably the rooftop infinity pool and pool deck.

Flowers arrived at about 8pm at the hotel recept, and as per informed by Naumi, the delivery man told them that the receiver knows about it. Naumi decided there wasn’t a need to inform me.

It was only till night time 7pm when they called to inform me about the flowers. they then expected me to travel back to the hotel to collect back my flowers, even suggested that they can keep till i am available to collect, when flowers are perishable.

The room is tiny and not well maintained. The towels are thin and cheap material, with holes. Extremely disgusted with the condition. No view at all even if you request for a high floor. Don't expect much of a service as well. It's mediocre. Please also note that check out time is 11am and late check is 1130.

The rooftop swimming pool offers paranoiac views of the city. I like to share my experience of dropping my gold wedding ring over the rooftop pool, and the staff managed to find it even after we gave up on searching after a few hours. I highly recommend this hotel to anyone who wants to walk and explore Singapore. Most taxis will refuse to enter the CDB even if you offer them extra to hire because of heavy traffic, and you won't regret having a hotel centrally located.

Didn't include breakfast as we knew we'd be waking up at odd times and this turned out to be a wise move. We walked downtown every morning and explored the city instead. The room was big and well served with everything we needed. When we were already on our way to the airport I got a message from the reception saying I'd left all my jewellry next to the bed. This included my wedding ring, engagement ring and other bits with huge sentimental value. I was horrified and asked if they would courier it to my London address which they did.

Naumi Hotel Singapore,Chic hotel with all the animals,"Very nice hotel close to the Suntac convention center where we were attending a conference. Initially booked a larger brand hotel through the conference website but happened upon Naumi hotel which was closed and advertised as a boutique hotel so we switched.

The lady at reception was very helpful with checking us in, telling us about all the amenities and suggesting places we could grab some food at the late hour, including delivery. The rooms are stylish, clean and comfortable. Took us a bit to figure out which light switch went with which light as the layout was a little confusing.

However the hotel already had the best years behind itself and needs urgent refurbishment. Some of the hotel areas also made some tacky impressions, especially the lobby and pool deck bar. Mildew can be spotted in various parts of the open-air premises so some barrels of paint would definately help. The breakfast was... a joke.

We were there for the grand prix, and you can even see most of the circuit (or make it out) from the infinity pool. The staff are friendly and attentive, they'll remember where you went for the day when you return and ask you about it, and no task is too big. The Indian food is great, and you can eat up by the tables in the pool area. The only thing I would say, is they rent out the pool area for parties, which means guests can not use it, it would be good if the hotel advised of this when booking - we were there for several nights, so it didn't really bother us, but if you were only there one or two, it would be annoying if you",5 out of 5,September 2017,5.0 of 5 stars,#46 of 373 hotels in Singapore,0.33833333333333343,0.6266666666666667,66.91666666666667,62.66666666666667,33.83333333333334,Amenities

We didn't feel there was enough choice for the 25 dollars charged so we only had breakfast twice. We would have preferred to eat breakfast at the hotel but didn't !! We didn't feel the service by the pool was very good either? The bar person wasn't around half the time and wasn't very helpful when trying to choose a drink. We only went there a couple of evenings but again that was because of the poor service? The only other thing we thought was very disappointing was the facility offered to freshen up on our last day??? It was no more than a toilet with a shower in it?

Naumi Hotel Singapore,Mr,Great location. Very nice and cozy hotel. Terrific and extremely helpful staff. The pool on the roof is nice and a good place to relax for a bit in the middle of a hot day. The only negatives that we have found is a combined shower and a toilet with no shower curtain or a door which makes everything wet. No convenient places to hang the towels and a sink is inside the room which makes it somewhat inconvenient and gives lack of privacy. Again no place to hang the towels near the sink and water splashes while washing up makes floor and nearby luggage a bit wet.,4 out of 5,December 2017,5.0 of 5 stars,#46 of 373 hotels in Singapore,0.1381111111111111,0.6766666666666666,56.90555555555555,67.66666666666666,13.81111111111111,Amenities

The bed was comfortable and had very large pillows which made for a very nice rest. The rooms come with a rain shower and one of the funkiest tap faucets I have ever seen.

Naumi Hotel Singapore,Excellent location and helpful staff,"Stayed here for a work trip since it was a hop skip and jump from my workplace. Pro's Great location, amazing staff, decent sized and equipped rooms with avg view Con's The amenities unfortunately do not justify the cost, maybe it is the location premium. What was disappointing was the breakfast buffet and the cost they charged vis-a-vis the spread. Even though on a work trip I did not want to opt for the breakfast.

Naumi Hotel Singapore,Very dissapointed.,"On arrival we saw a sign stating a private event had been booked for the roof top terrace for our second day from 5pm, very annoying as we chose this hotel for the roof top pool terrace area so we could enjoy the view, swim and relax. We arrived back from out sightseeing by 2pm to relax for a couple of hrs knowing the party was at 5pm only to be surrounded by men moving furniture and guests to set up. I left when they put a large buffet table directly infront on me blocking the view and making me feel uncomfortable. My son left 5 mins after we arrived as it was so noisy and we were obviously in the way. Would I stay here again? No! There are plenty of other places to stay in the 5 star range who actually deliver 5 stars. Staff were very nice and check in was good.

Naumi Hotel Singapore,Good business stay in downton Singapore,This hotel is really well located in Singapore close to many restaurants and bars. The room quality is good even at the lowest price and the staff are friendly and helpful. The only reasons this hotel didnt get a 5 were:- Breakfast range is limited (but sufficient) The pool was shut the afternoon of the only day I could use it and the setup for a 5pm event started at 2:30... which made a lot of noise so I left. I am never sure that a hotel should close advertised services for private functions. You cannot get a late night (11pm) drink at the hotel - but there are bars in the same road.

Naumi Hotel Singapore,Missed the mark on the details,"Stayed here for one night as part of a longer business trip, to escape the boring business hotels. There were some nice things in the room, like the quartz marble sink with underlighting, the large (and comfortable) bed and high rain shower. I found the room to be quite spacious. The roof infinity pool was small but nice, whith a great view over the rooftops. Decor in the room was fairly neutral. However, when a hotel advertises itself as boutique and luxury, then I expect that they will pay attention to small details, and that just wasn't the case in my experience here.

Loved the decor & trendy furniture. The roof top bar & infinity pool were magical with views over the city & across the road from Raffles. Ideal for a short stay. Not much storage in the rooms for longer stays but good use of space. My only criticism would be the towels & loo paper which were not luxury.

It definitely has a boutique type feel, with really nice touches in the room. Firstly, it is in a great location. Overlooking Raffles hotel, you can easily pop in for an obligatory Singapore sling. The marina Bay Area is only a 20 minute easy, safe walk away and the more central points of Orchard Rd and Bugis are again within 30 mins walking.

Naumi Hotel Singapore,Delightful,We stayed in the hotel for 2 nights in the habitat room. The hotel is very centrally located and is compact. Our room had a small window but was very well and efficiently designed. All was available in only a rather small area. Well done! Breakfast is downstairs in the lobby/restaurant/bar. Good quality and enough choices. Around the corner is the famous Raffles hotel. Only a few hundred meters walk is the central busstop for Big Bus tours with 4 routes around Singapore. Since our flight was really late at night we asked reception for a late check out. For SGD150.00 this could be arranged until 6pm or SGD230.00 for an extra night. We ended up booking an extra night via booking.com as the rate there was better than in the hotel.... we needed a 9pm checkout.

Naumi Hotel Singapore,Good stay,"We stayed for three nights in Singapore before continuing on to the rest of our three week trip in Asia. This was our first time in Singapore.

The staff are friendly and always ready to assist you. Although the room we had was a bit small, it was clean and had a modern feel. We didn’t try the food at the restaurant because there is so much awesome food everywhere outside, but we did enjoy a few glasses of wine at the bar during their happy hour.

None of the cupboard doors close anymore, and the decor is quite twee instead of the Chic they were trying for. The wet room shower/bath leaks into the main bedroom room, there is a smell of drain and the hot water is warm at best so didn’t even attempt a bath.

Naumi Hotel Singapore,Amazing Stay!,"This is my second stay with Naumi Hotel. I picked it because of the location as it is centralised, so it’s nearby to town! The mini bar is complimentary. The room is beautiful and cosy. I requested for a room at the highest floor (level 9) and the view was marvellous! The pool area was nice too. However, the bar was closed while I was there but that’s okay. The only downside was the WIFI and the TV. The WIFI’s strength was okay, but if you’re streaming movies/TV shows, it may take some to buffer. As for the TV, I experienced a laggy output but I think that’s because my device was too far away from the Apple TV. Other than that, the service was excellent. Will I come back? Definitely.

Naumi Hotel Singapore,"Resplendent yet Underrated, Best Hotel Experience","My bf planned a surprise birthday staycation for me during the dates 10 - 12 March (3D2N). It was an amazing set-up and the event was a success. After the adrenaline died off after seeing the pretty surprise being pulled off, I finally basked in the beauty of the room. The designer room (CC) was curated in detail; everything from the time you step in to the end of the room tour was as though it was intentional. Instead of the typical hotel room whose pathway is just a straight line (door -> bathroom -> bed), this was a beautiful tour that was almost like a spacious roundabout. From the moment you entered the door, straight ahead was the toilet -> bathroom, turn the corner and there was the gigantic bed sitting in the middle facing a large-screen TV backed against automatic",5 out of 5,March 2021,5.0 of 5 stars,#46 of 373 hotels in Singapore,0.22000000000000006,0.52,61.0,52.0,22.000000000000007,Services

Naumi Hotel Singapore,Worst Experience ever,Literally the worst hotel experience of my life. We booked a staycation here on 3rd April. Arrived on time for check in and was told to wait in the hotel lobby. Subsequently waited 3 hours because they had overbooked and were still cleaning and preparing rooms. I think there were people there who waited >5 hours and still had not gotten a room. In the end we gave up and left with the assurance from the hotel staff that they would provide a full refund including vouchers used. It has been 3 months since and I have called and emailed them multiple times without a single reply.

Silly little things were annoyances on checking in - room door would not work (no battery in the lock) so we had to come back 40 minutes later and ended up in another room anyway. Then we get into the new room. No luggage in there. No towels either as apparently they had run out. Also, the rooftop bar unmanned and the phone not working, so we had to ring the reception from our handphone and ask to be connected to the bar. Annoyance, not a terrible experience.

Faizal gave us a short intro about the hotel otw to our room, showing the art display which was nice. Requested for the birthday package and they kindly prepared a halal cake for my sister, thank you! Got the habitat room, it was clean and cosy - things that I don't fancy is the toilet cus no bidet and I wish there is white light instead of all warm lights which make the room very dim but maybe that's the concept so nvm. Love the infinity pool and the rooftop view very much!

Naumi Hotel Singapore,Birthday Staycation,We had a great staycation week ending off our stay at Naumi just because of their beautiful designer rooms they have. We got their Andy Warhol Theme for my partner’s birthday which they did a little decor on the bed with a champagne and a birthday Tiramisu Cake. I don’t drink so it’s a little extra gift for my partner. The Team over at Naumi are friendly and accommodating as well in terms of service; they are great. Even the housekeeping were tiptop with cleanliness of the room. The bathtub is so huge too although the water tank supply might not be suitable to fill the tub with hot water as the heat runs out after awhile filling it up or showering after a period of time.

Naumi Hotel Singapore,Disappointing,"Read many good reviews and we decided to book a night at this hotel over the weekend. However, it was not what we had expected. Shall start off with the good points: 1. The hotel is situated at a good location - walkable to City Hall, Bugis and Suntec. Train stations and buses are close by as well. 2. Complimentary mini bar 3. Bed was pretty comfy 4. The staff who checked us in, brought us right up to the room and gave a room tour - nice touch of service Despite the above points, here are the reasons why the stay was less than desirable. 1. Check-in process was quite long even though we were the second group to be checked in.

Naumi Hotel Singapore,Minimoon,"Review on Naumi. Addressing few questions which is common. √There are many types of rooms with patio, tub and even a round tub √All rooms are non smoking but you get to swim and drink at the rooftop with a smoking corner, just like clubs √Infinity pool is so damn good that you can see all the lights around and perfect for pictures. There are comfy sofas, chairs and rocking chairs too √Rooms are well equipped and clean √Staffs are so friendly and accommodating. If service is very important to you at your stay, like me, this is the place like home √Accessible by train bus and car.

Naumi Hotel Singapore,A quiet get-away in the middle of the city,"I chose this hotel to stay over the weekend to celebrate my hubby's birthday.

Late check-out is 2pm(depending on how full the hotel is) The room was at one corner of the hallway so no traffic from outside came by so in a way it was really private and comfy. it was like a holiday. the bed is soooo comfy that you'd just be tempted to KO in it",5 out of 5,September 2021,5.0 of 5 stars,#46 of 373 hotels in Singapore,0.16500000000000004,0.40055555555555544,58.25,40.05555555555554,16.500000000000004,Services
