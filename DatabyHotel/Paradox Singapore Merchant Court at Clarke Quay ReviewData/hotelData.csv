Paradox Singapore Merchant Court at Clarke Quay,Great Hotel in good location,The hotel is very comfortably situated right at Clarke Quay. The staff is very friendly and helpful. We have bought an upgrade to an executive room for 70 Singapore $ per night upon arrival which was more than worthwhile. Besides the larger room with balcony and direct view on the Quay we got access to the Executive Lounge whith breakfast and non-alcoholic drinks all day included. (Normally breakfast costs 25 $ per person). During Happy Hour in the evening the alcoholic drinks were included as well as a snack buffet which was quite large so we did not even need to go out for dinner every night. The pool area is maybe not the most spacious but good enough. We will be back when being in Singapore the next time.,5 out of 5,May 2018,4.0 of 5 stars,#58 of 373 hotels in Singapore,0.28171875,0.5165178571428571,64.0859375,51.651785714285715,28.171875,Value
Paradox Singapore Merchant Court at Clarke Quay,Amazing hotel!,"We stayed here as a family of 5 (children aged 12, 9 and 6) for three nights as a stopover on the way from the UK to Australia. We had two rooms with a connecting door, one with a king size bed and the other a twin room with a third single bed added. I cannot think of one bad thing to say about this wonderful hotel - the staff are amazing, it’s in a great location, the pool is great and the food is good. Breakfast was out of this world, so much choice of every type of cuisine you could want. We ate an evening meal at the Blue Potato poolside restaurant one evening and enjoyed snacks and one last Singapore Sling cocktail as we waited for our taxi to pick us up for the return journey to the airport.

We are extremely delighted and pleased throughout the whole event and planning stage (although we had different co-coordinators).

The room was perfect, clean, spacious, the bathroom immaculate. For once we had no noise in our room, no neighbours leaving to catch planes at 1 am! The location is ideal, next door to the MRT, short distance to Vivo City, Raffles Place, and Orchard Rd. We could walk to Chinatown, Peoples Place. Clarke Quay was next door, if you like pubs and restaurants. The staff were lovely, no complaints at all.

Paradox Singapore Merchant Court at Clarke Quay,Great location,"Having stayed at a number of hotels in Singapore over the years, this is the one I now use as my base when on business. It is located on Clarke Quay, backing on to an array of bars and restaurants. Check-in was super-efficient and my standard room was a decent size with a comfortable bed and good workspace. The bar area is reasonably basic but functional and breakfast is incredible in the restaurant - an unbelievable array of buffet foods that cater for all tastes. My only negative observation here was that it sometimes takes a while to get seated for breakfast and the tea/coffee which is served at the table often took far too long. That said, it certainly did not detract from my stay. Taxis are quite easy to obtain at the front of the hotel.

Paradox Singapore Merchant Court at Clarke Quay,A second stay at Merchant Court but not enjoyable,We stayed at this hotel ten years ago and rebooked for our last night in Singapore before travelling home from a stay in Thailand. We were staying on a Saturday night so specifically asked for a quiet room as we know the area is busy for nightlife. Unfortunately we were given a room on the 2nd floor which was virtually at street level. There was a really bad smell in the room and the shower was small but these things we could just about put up with as it was only 1 night. What we couldn’t put up with was when trying to sleep there was a constant racket of people screeching and yelling from outside and moped noises from the road. There were also bugs in the room. By midnight we rang down and insisted they move us. Most annoying as we had our kids with us so we had to pack,2 out of 5,February 2019,4.0 of 5 stars,#58 of 373 hotels in Singapore,-0.12896825396825398,0.417063492063492,43.551587301587304,41.7063492063492,12.896825396825399,Cleaniness

Paradox Singapore Merchant Court at Clarke Quay,Comfortable stay,Great hotel in the heart of Clarke Quay - central location for walking around all areas of Singapore. Room was comfortable and clean. Hotel breakfast was OK but a late meal when we arrived at the Ellenborough cafe was met with fairly slow service - almost that they were getting ready to finish for the evening and needed to lay the tables for breakfast. The meal was OK especially after a long flight into Singapore. We booked a walking tour of the city on the first day and this was super and gave us a good background of the area - it also enabled us to explore further the following day. We had a super meal at the Colony restaurant at the Ritz Carlton - one of the best in our five week holiday.

We upgraded room to 9th floor as it was slightly bigger and quieter, which was ideal. Air con lovely and quiet. Room servicing spot on. Breakfasts very good - huge buffet to choose from. Pool area lovely, though very busy with kids at weekend -the week was lovely and quiet!

It didn't take more than about 10 mins to get anywhere. This isn't a luxury hotel but it was comfortable and the rooms nice although a little on the small side. The menu at the restaurant is limited but they have an excellent breakfast buffet. The staff are very friendly and helpful.

Paradox Singapore Merchant Court at Clarke Quay,Lovely hotel with helpful staff,We stayed 5 days in an upgraded room overlooking Clarke Quay. This also gave us access to the Executive Lounge with free drinks and light food every evening before dinner. This was a nice touch but we only used it once because of other dinner plans. There was some noise from Clarke Quay at night but with the balcony doors closed and drapes drawn it wasn't loud by any means. The dining at Swissotel was much better than what's offered at Clarke Quay especially the buffet breakfast which catered for both asian and western tastes. Staff were friendly and helpful. Unfortunately Mrs V got a sudden toothache one evening and the staff not only found an after hours dentist but accompanied her to the clinic because it was a bit hard to find.

Paradox Singapore Merchant Court at Clarke Quay,Impractical Bathtub,"Stayed from 28-29Dec. First of all the check in process took longer than expected. ( Prepaid thru Expedia ). Even guest who was next to me who is a Accor Plus Priority member took just as long. The management might want to do away with the bathtub in room #236 ( hope is the only design flaw in the entire hotel ) before any accident from happening. The entry point accessing to the tub was not only narrow but also a challenge in getting in and out. The size wise is also pathetic. The water temperature also fluctuate badly. The towel rack which is mounted above the WC is not useful and Lightnings is inadequate.

It was expensive and of course had enormous sentimental value. Search of her room and belongings turned up nothing. This absolutely wiped out all the wonderful memories of our trip to Singapore.

While it was quiet, it was just halfway up so the view was blocked by other buildings, making it claustrophobic and depressing. We called and enquired about changing, and they moved us to 915, which had much more of a view and “opened up the sky”.

Paradox Singapore Merchant Court at Clarke Quay,Wonderful stay.,We cannot praise this hotel enough. From entering the lobby we were greeted by such helpful reception staff. We arrived early and were able to leave our bags until our room became available. The bags were taken to the room as soon as it became free and before we arrived back at the hotel. It was perfect. We decided to upgrade to the executive level and this proved to be exceptionally good value. Our room was on the 11th floor overlooking Clarks Quay. It was a huge room with a considerable number of amenities and we felt spoilt staying there. The upgrade provided us with access to the executive lounge where they have happy hour between 6 pm and 8 pm.

We even left behind some unwanted clothes in our room as our bags could not take anymore luggage on the departure day, the staff took the effort to email us once we were back in the UK to ask whether we wanted then shipped home as they assumed we had forgotten to pack them.

After covid, we’ve tried few buffet restaurants and see how they go about the changes implemented. And I would say, Ellenborough is just as great, if not better, like before. Their spread is waaaay better than other buffets we’ve been to! And the service is just superb. Serving food every table instead of the previous buffet set up where people take their own food is just not easy. But everyone who served us last night were all happy to serve! 😊 Sorry if we kept ordering (food is just too good) and we greatly appreciate your patience and the way you took good care of us!

Paradox Singapore Merchant Court at Clarke Quay,"Good facilities, but choose you room carefully","I stayed here for a week while working remotely. This was my third or fourth visit to this hotel, chosen very deliberately because of its facilities, level of service, and location. I chose a larger room with a balcony and view of the river and was disappointed that the room was actually no larger than the standard room; the added square footage was mainly due to a giant vacant entryway that was basically wasted space. There was no easy chair or sofa in the room; the only place to sit down was the desk chair. It was also very dark at night, there were no overhead lights, and only two bedside table lamps. I requested and asked for a floor lamp and the easy chair which were brought, but considering this room was advertised as much larger (43sq m vs 30) and was more expensive, I",3 out of 5,March 2022,4.0 of 5 stars,#58 of 373 hotels in Singapore,-0.05544444444444446,0.49002777777777773,47.22777777777778,49.00277777777777,5.544444444444446,Location

The complementary waters in the room each day was nice but I don't know if everyone does that. The fridge was helpful for sure. Breakfast was nice - usual western stuff - half baked pastries shoved in the oven for 5 minutes, pancakes and french toast out of a packet, cereals toast etc. To be fair if I'd tried the Asian stuff i would probably had been better off as that all seemed freshly cooked but that's not my thing.

We had breakfast on both days of our stay and had tried their dinner too at the Ellenborough Cafe. While the breakfast spread is impressively wide, the dinner is somehow disappointing. They are having seafood and barbecue dinner promotion but the bbq station are just pre-cooked meats displayed outside with no Chef to assist, it doesn't look appetising at all. However, the service provided by the team is really impressive. Regardless of how busy the restaurant is during breakfast, the staff are very attentive and friendly.

I assume she was Filipino from her accent) reprimanding an old auntie waitress for some issues. The supervisor said something while she pointed her finger 1cm in front of the old aunties face. The old auntie probably made some mistake (i guess) but as a supervior/boss, It would be best if you could have a little EQ and leadership quality. Get your staff to work with you. Not work for you!!

Paradox Singapore Merchant Court at Clarke Quay,Dinner experience (24 Sept 2022),"It's been a while since I had buffet since the onset of Covid 19. The last time I patronised Ellenborough Cafe was several years back. Was a bit apprehensive when I see the long queue and can't help but to think a compromise on service is inevitable, with the shortage of labour in hotel industry. It is quite apparent that the wait staff are made up of older work force. However, I must applaud them for the efficiency on delivering their service. The only down side is the lack of smile on their face but I know it's tough working in hotel now, so I'm good.

Paradox Singapore Merchant Court at Clarke Quay,Just OK,"If this is advertised as a 5 star hotel - it falls short. Our stay was OK, but not outstanding. We arrived around 10:15pm following a flight from Dubai. We asked if room service would be available - we were told only until 10:30pm so reception raced through our check-in and we bolted to our room. When we got there we could not find the room service menu - then we realised it was probably on the TV menu.

Paradox Singapore Merchant Court at Clarke Quay,Loved it!,"Great location, excellent and friendly staff. I stayed for 5 nights and found the whole experience very satisfying. From the welcome & checkin experience to the service and great staff in the restaurant / bar. The room was excellent, spotless and very well serviced every day. A special shout out to the Concierge, he was above excellent, even arranging a car and driver for the day to take us to Malaysia. If I had one suggestion, it would be to open the ""Blue Potato Bar"" at the swimming pool. For some reason the bar was closed and the pool area was very well frequented. It took a while for the ordered drinks to come from within the hotel, this is a bit of a lost opportunity. Overall, a fantastic stay.

The location is great, so close to CQ itself and just a short walk to the CQ MRT station. We use the MRT a lot o being so close was perfect!

We did use the self check out when it was time to leave which was very quick and easy. The rooms were very large especially by Singapore standards and the bathroom was large too.

If you dont want to eat in their restaurant there are a large choice of other eateries within a minutes walk away. Within a low cost taxi range are the gardens by the bay and the Merlion is within walking distance. We chose room and breakfast and the breakfast choice was extensive.

Paradox Singapore Merchant Court at Clarke Quay,Nice hotel spoiled by unethical behaviour,We had requested a fold out bed for each room several weeks prior. We arrived to be told that there were no fold out beds. They said we should sleep 3 people to a bed which was shocking and also impossible with children who are 5' 10 tall. I had paid for 2 rooms with 3 guests in each so was very upset that our only option was to pay an additional $620 for another room which we begrudgingly did. I felt utterly ripped off. It was clear that they didn't tell us that there were no additional beds available as we would have cancelled the booking. It is sad that they have chosen profit over customer service. They should have done the right thing and provided adequate accommodation for 6 persons at the price I paid.,1 out of 5,January 2023,4.0 of 5 stars,#58 of 373 hotels in Singapore,-0.07063492063492062,0.5793650793650794,46.46825396825397,57.936507936507944,7.063492063492062,Services

I have to say that Singapore was great - a mix of heritage and modernity - with some utterly spectacular elements. The Paradox was formerly the Swisshotel at Clarke Quay. So basically it was previously a Mercure in a very good location for whatever you want to do in Singapore. We variously walked back from our trip to Raffles comfortably. We even walked all the way to Marina Bay and back for our booking there. We walked to the Maxwell Food Court and back - and many other places. It's very convenient for all this.

Although the hotel may appear a bit old looking from the outside inside is fantastic. Our bedroom was immaculate and modern. It had everything we would need, bathrobes, slippers, pillow menu and even a balcony to sit and have an evening drink. From arriving to leaving the hotel the service was outstanding.

Paradox Singapore Merchant Court at Clarke Quay,Spacious luxury next to Boat Quay,"Fairly luxurious in a relaxed style where everything just worked great. I hadn’t stayed in Singapore for over 10 years and my old standard (the Grand Copthorne Waterfront) seemed out of line on pricing so it was time to find somewhere new. The Paradox is very close to Clarke Quay MRT (though oddly the hotel doesn’t tell you which exit to take) which is under S$2 and about an hour by MRT from Changi - not everything in Singapore is expensive! Rooms are spacious with Nespresso, tea, roomsafe, desk …. and a very comfortable bed. WiFi fine. Breakfast very good (not quite GCW standard though). You’re right next to Boat Quay so evening eating options are very good (though BQ isn’t quite what it was 15 years ago - COVID or modernization, not sure what’s to blame).
