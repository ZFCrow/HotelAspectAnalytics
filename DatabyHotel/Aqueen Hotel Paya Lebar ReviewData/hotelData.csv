Aqueen Hotel Paya Lebar,1st time at Petite Menu review,"Went to Peitite Menu Paya Lebar today to have our family weekend lunch at abt 12noon. It was our first time there so we purchased fave vouchers x 4 to try the food out. Upon entering the cafe, we randomly picked a small table for 4 pax as we have 2 adults and 2 kids. A middle-aged be-spectacled chinese waiting staff came to us and ""suggested"" we move to a longer table (8 seater row) but I didn't want to take up a bigger space just in case the lunch crowd were to come in, so I politely turned him down. He started to show some impatience as if we were trying to be difficult so we moved to the longer table. Nobody came to us for the 1st ten mins until I waived a few times before a Malay staff, also middle-aged guy came to take our order.

I was not expecting too much from it before but after staying here, I can say that the price is still reasonable and affordable.

Area is near the MRT where lots of places to eat and shop as well (Paya Lebar Square, Singapore Post).

Aqueen Hotel Paya Lebar,"Tiny Room, Busted Shower","This is a backdated review from my stay in Aug 2022, but I stayed here for 4 days, 3 nights. Stayed here for a work trip along with my wife and found the room to be really tiny, aircon was either really cold or really hot. Found myself waking up in the middle of the night to either turn on or off the air con, there was no in between even if i set it to 24-26 degrees. On top of that, the shower was pretty much broken, and water pressure was nothing and dripping down the cord. But what left the bad taste in our mouth was the attitude from the front desk when we requested an extra towel. There is one specific lady who has a real attitude problem. Can't remember her name but I'm sure I'm not the only complaint this staff had.

Aqueen Hotel Paya Lebar,Typical Singapore Chain Hotel,"Reception was OK. No porter to help with our luggage. Had to ask for a trolley which had flat tyres. The room is nice. Beds are comfortable. Bath was a nice touch. However the bathroom floor floods when showering. Not a fan of the shower being in the bath due to mobility issues and it only has a shower curtain. Miserable cheap Charlies only have 6 local TV channels with only 1 having some English language shows and the rest in Chinese. Not acceptable when they have foriegn guests. A lot of noisey guests that seem to think they need to have loud conversations in the hallway at night. Room servicing is poor. Asked for servicing at 9am, still nothing by 1pm.

Aqueen Hotel Paya Lebar,The Worst Hotel I Ever Stayed In,"Considering the higher range price range for its size and location, you would expect a hotel not leave you with an experience of dorm room. Above All!!! The acoustic in this hotel is a disaster. From the room doors shattering sound from the all floor, to the conversations held in the corridor. It’s not only not sound proof to the minimum, the low quality building standard somehow amplifies these sounds. Almost every night I was awaken by slammed doors and people’s conversations from the floor. Further; The hotel room is small. Bathroom is very small and very badly lit. Water pressure is insufficient. The 2 lifts are often not sufficient considering the heavy traffic of student shuttling in it between floors. WiFi internet connectivity is extremely slow.

Aqueen Hotel Paya Lebar,Much less than the little expected,"We booked Aqueen for it’s convenient location for specific business. We did not expect more than a decent sleep and basic amenities. But the room was the tiniest we ever stayed. No place to put our luggage, which we kept closed and standing behind the door and we had to move around in order to get in and out of the room. The room was not properly cleaned when we got in and it remained equally very superficially done the next day. The bathroom was equally tiny with the great originality of the sink outside of it. The bed could sleep midgets, so my husband’s feet were hanging out and he is not a huge guy. There was not really space to put our clothes, but in any case we could not put our luggage somewhere to open them. Breakfast was awkward; not for non Asians.

Room lighting is too dark though and room doors close too loudly even if you tried your best to close it softly, can be annoying if you have busy neighbors. Housekeeping could do better too, I stayed 12 days and only have them make up the room twice (by my choice) they only replaced new towels and make the bed but the floor was left dusty.

Aqueen Hotel Paya Lebar,Stay at Aqueen Hotel paya Lebar,Hotel very clean. Room small but comfortable. 12th floor or Rooftop has nice views to the city. Good to take photos The local area seems quiet. Five min walk up the road to shopping center where you can buy food. Also Trains close by to shopping center. Management very helpful and polite. Only one negative is if your having breakfast at the hotel get there early as the doors open 7am. The food goes fast and there very slow to replenish. So if your busy and need breakfast before you go out get there early or miss out.

Aqueen Hotel Paya Lebar,Enjoyed our stay,We recently stayed at Aqueen hotel Singapore for 3 days & it was very comfortable and relaxing although rooms are very small but equipped with all required amenities located very conveniently as Paya Lebar MRT is very near. I prefered to purchase Tourist Pass of MRT for S$ 20 & plus S$ 10 deposit which is refundable (if refund claimed within 5 days from expiry of pass) available at selected MRT stations. This entitles you unlimited rides in train & bus both for 3 days. Single day pass also available. Morning breakfast is very good & environment of restaurant is nice as you can enjoy it at outside the restaurant in open to sky.

Aqueen Hotel Paya Lebar,Good and affordable stay,"Chose Aqueen Hotel, Paya Lebar, because I wanted to try out this new hotel. When I first arrived I was greeted by courteous front desk Staff and the check in was very smooth. Room is very comfortable and best of all free wifi is also available in rooms. As I was feeling hungry I went down to the 2nd level restaurant, Petite Menu Restaurant to have a meal which was very satisfying. For your info they serve local food and when you are here you must not give it a miss. Generally a good stay and I will definitely come back.

First thing I noticed was the spanking newness of the rooms and its grounds, and it made me feel even more safe with a local security company as neighbors. They have a rooftop which has lovely landscaping and beautiful unobstructed views of the surrounding areas.
