The Fullerton Bay Hotel Singapore,Bayfront luxury oasis,"The Fullerton Bay hotel has a couple of fantastic things going for it. First, being fairly new, it has all the nice modern fittings that sets it apart from other hotels in its class (and there aren’t many operating at this upper echelon of luxury anyway, and they are mostly older and dated). Second, and more importantly, it has an exclusive, unrivalled location on the bayfront promenade. Other hotels in the area can claim to have a bay view, but only the Fullerton Bay can boast to be right at the bayfront, over the water in fact. Given this, it is absolutely incumbent that you minimally book a bay view room to fully enjoy the hotel’s unique appeal (yes, the premium over the entry rooms is totally worth it; it will make perfect sense every time you enter the room).

The Fullerton Bay Hotel Singapore,Great BayView but had smoking neighbours. Poor sleep because of the thin/soft pillows.,"[Positives] 1. It is the view. you get an absolutely unblocked view to MBS. you can chill by the balcony whole day. 2. the swimming pool is massive and tastefully designed with 2 x Jacuzzi by the sides. 3. Breakfast selection was ok. (much lesser selection than Fullerton Hotel) 4. Bath robes are probably the best across all hotels in Singapore. 5. we were celebrating valentine day and they placed 2 bears in the room for us. Tks! [Negatives] 1. as the header suggested, yup, I had neighbours who smoked at the balcony beside me. not sure if it was to my left or right. everytime they smoked, we will just get back into the room.

The Fullerton Bay Hotel Singapore,"An incredible hotel, with impeccable decor and service","This is my second visit to Fullerton Bay Hotel. I honestly wouldn't have chanced upon this hotel if not for COVID. The search for a staycation landed me at this beautiful hotel. I stayed over during a semi lock down in Singapore. There was a promotion, and the hotel was selling with a complimentary night stay. It was a hard to resist offer. Took the offer, and stayed two nights with the Premier Bay View Room (I had an upgrade). The view was fantastic. The sounds of lapping water against the hotel was extremely therapeutic. I could sit hours at the balcony and enjoy the view with the constant cool breeze. The decor is impressive. Modern and yet classic. Service was fabulous. Breakfast was served in the room.

The Fullerton Bay Hotel Singapore,Afternoon High Tea,"5 stars! We were half an hour too early for the high tea to commence. However, instead of asking us to wait elsewhere and come back later, Maria offered us a table along the walkway to sit while waiting. We saw that there were table seatings closer to the glass window with a view, so we enquired if we could get the seats there. Unfortunately, as we made the booking late, she informed that it was fully booked but would make the arrangements if there was a cancellation. Shortly after, she came back to inform us that there was indeed a window table available for us. We were very pleased that she took action immediately to see if she could help us secure a window seating instead of brushing our request off.

The afternoon platter surprised me with a wide range of flavours, both savoury & sweet. Staff were very attentive (which can be rare in some F&B establishments). I never have to raised my hand once to get anything I need (which is even more rare, considering how impatient I usually am). The view faces Marina Bay Sands (we are sitting across the bay).

The Fullerton Bay Hotel Singapore,Average stay in Singapore,"We stayed in 4 hotels across 1 week and this was by far the ""worst"" hotel experience.

No answer when we called down to the lobby for help, no turn down service, no help with baggage - definitely not what we'd consider a 5 star standard.

The first was during check-in when the guest who came after us was serviced first despite us standing in front of the counter for a few minutes, while he just came straight from the door. Secondly, the light would not turn on when I had to use the bathroom at 6am. Instead, an eye-searing emergency light flashed for minutes as a technician was trying to fix it. By the time the problem was resolved, it had almost been an hour and my jet lag was exacerbated since I arrived from an 18-hour flight from Los Angeles just the day prior.

The Fullerton Bay Hotel Singapore,Disappointing experience,"Our stay at the Fullerton bay hotel was disappointing. While making a reservation on email, the staff took almost 10 hours to respond. By the time they responded they then informed that they ran out of rooms. After I gave feedback they managed to make a room available for us. At check-in, staff were not welcoming nor friendly. At 3pm they told us the room was still not ready - this is standard check-in time and a well-run five star hotel should not fail this expectation. Upon giving feedback (which was met with unhappiness by the staff receiving it), they reluctantly changed our room and gave us one that was available. The room was old and dated with a noticeable hole in the curtains. In general, we noticed staff lacked motivation and pride in their work.

The only thing I hated was the baby crib they provided, it looked like it wasn't being properly maintained. It was clean but it looked aged. And I had to bend down so low to pick up my baby.

The Fullerton Bay Hotel Singapore,Long check-in and Hotel categorises guests according to room types,"Poor customer service from the front desk. The manager Kelly Shum clearly categorises the hotel guests according to the room type. Do not waste your money staying in the Fullerton Bay but rather we recommend the Fullerton Hotel which the staffs there are friendlier and more welcoming. Check-in paperwork took at least 20minutes but to only inform that the room would not be ready anytime soon. The manager used condescending tone to inform that the guests that received their keys before us were staying in different room types despite arriving later than us.

A very warm welcome when we first arrived and continual touches of brilliance throughout or 6 night stay.

We were hugely impressed by the Concierge and especially Andrew Yip who was a constant source of information, assistance and recommendations. Andrew's guidance for our first ever visit to Singapore was invaluable and we can't thank him enough.

The Fullerton Bay Hotel Singapore,Marvellous 6 star experience,"Had a one night staycation over the Easter weekend with a couple of friends in a bay view room. We would like to thank Kelly, Andrew, Alvin for their warm hospitality and various prompt follow ups whenever we had any requests. Oliver also also offered to help us store our drinks in the hotel fridge when we mentioned the in room fridge was not cold. We had a good time and experience at the pool as well as Lantern bar for drinks in the evening. We were well served by Zool, Loges and Daniel who ensured our birthday celebration was tip top. They consistently checked in on us to ensure we have everything we need despite our table being located in the far corner of the bar. Breakfast in the morning was also a very grand affair.

Teams are trying but it looks like there is a gap in senior management oversight.

The Fullerton Bay Hotel Singapore,Very high quality hotel,"Stunning hotel, backed up by outstanding service. The construction and interior design of the Fullerton Bay make it a unique place to stay. The marina location is as central as it gets and the view across the water to MBS is a great one. We stayed in a third floor corner room, which was high spec and with views of the water on two sides. The rooftop pool is a special area for spending time in central Singapore. The Lantern bar is a great vantage point for evening drinks and watching the light show.

Bad: - Instead of keeping a peaceful mood on the great roof terrace in the morning and during the day, there is blunt music playing all the time from 7 in the morning like in a 3-star-beach-resort, destroying the peaceful atmosphere and also the concentration when for example reading a book. It's ok to have music after 6 when the rooftop bar opens, but please not before! - the Balmain amenities (shower gel etc.) smell like 80-yea-old-french-grandma-style.

A small refresh of carpets and decor in the rooms would bring it back to top shape.

The Fullerton Bay Hotel Singapore,Great to be back!,Great to be back post pandemic. The service from arrival is exceptional. The view of the marina is great and the staff planned a lovely surprise for our anniversary. They took photos of us and printed this and put it in our room which was super thoughtful. Hopefully they will get the diffusers back so that we can take a little piece of Fullerton Bay home with us. The only thing that was different to the last two times we stayed is that the breakfast was not quite up to the standard it used to be. We used to get greeted personally and they noted our preferences in the past. Otherwise it was great to be back.,5 out of 5,June 2023,5.0 of 5 stars,#1 of 372 hotels in Singapore,0.22720588235294117,0.46372549019607834,61.360294117647065,46.37254901960783,22.720588235294116,Services
