Orchard Hotel Singapore,Trapped in a Tiny Room with Tiny Window,"I don't understand how this hotel gets soaring reviews from all its quarantine guests, my experience here thus far is summarized by one word - stifling. I've been assigned to this hotel for my 14 nights SHN quarantine, naturally I understand that rooms cannot be chosen, as they are assigned accordingly. When I entered the room, my heart sank a little because the room is incredibly small - on par with those micro hotel rooms that I've stayed in Tokyo and New York. It's advertised as 28sqm online, but I fear it's actually smaller. I only traveled with one moderately large (28"" in length) suit case, but I have no space to open it and lay it out in the room unless I place it on the floor blocking my only narrow walking path or I flushed it towards the built in closet rack and have",2 out of 5,July 2021,4.0 of 5 stars,#78 of 372 hotels in Singapore,-0.00789551357733176,0.5984651711924439,49.60522432113341,59.84651711924439,0.7895513577331761,General
Orchard Hotel Singapore,"Average stay, poor afternoon tea and breakfast","A very average stay. Room is spacious and comfortable, well maintained considering it is a pretty old hotel. F&B is the biggest letdown, afternoon tea is nowhere near the quality of other hotel, kinda feel like leftover food from buffet due to weird combination of food items with cakes, sushi, curry puff, popiah, sandwich and without scone. Breakfast is probably the worst part of the hotel since we were notified to have our breakfast packed from orchard cafe to be consumed in room. This is P3HA instead of P2HA yet they don't allow dining in of breakfast buffet. The queue of the breakfast was very long, the spread of the breakfast is very poor for a 4-star hotel.

Orchard Hotel Singapore,Birthday Staycation,"I booked a room for 2 nights for my partner‚Äôs birthday celebration, and had a lot of preplanning that was yet to be done before they arrived. I had to rush off to pick up my partner after work, and went to the front desk to seek help on whether it was possible to get the room set up (balloons mainly) as I was running late and would not be able to do so myself. The girl mending the front desk, Amanda, personally went beyond the means to go up to get my room set up for me herself. I was so touched and impressed by the initiative she took, despite being busy and was not required for her to do so. My partner was really touched by everything, and I have to thank Amanda for her big part in it. Thank you for making my staycation such a wonderful experience.

The window was covered with algae, so it was not possible to look outside. It had the appearance of a fish tank which hadn't been cleaned in years. It rained during the night and I woke up to water which leaked into the room. Upon inspection, it was obvious that the glass was unsealed and the frame was deteriorated. In the pictures, you can see how they made past plaster repairs which did nothing to solve the leak problem. The room smelled dank from the repeated leaks (Singapore = rain) and their maintenance was clearly incompetent as was obvious from the buckling plastic and cracks. The bed sheets had blood stains. The shower head was broken.

Orchard Hotel Singapore,"Old, tired and run down hotel","This hotel would be a lot better if it didn't have so many maintenance issues. Our Aircon was leaking and flooded our hallway whilst we were out. We moved rooms but then the shower wouldn't drain in the new room.

Orchard Hotel Singapore,Low quality service at Orchard Cafe restaurant,"I have a very bad experience at the Orchard Cafe restaurant this afternoon for our NDP buffet lunch. The male staff serving out table (Table #1) totally ignored our request for more cold water and walk away for 3 times while I was having some spicy food and needed some cold water urgently. I was so furious that I have brought this up to the female restraurant manager. I am not sure what attitude issue this staff was having at that time but it is definitely not acceptable to totally ignore repeated requests from the customer and walk away.

Orchard Hotel Singapore,"Old Hotel, can be better","Stayed 2 nights at Orchard hotel to celebrate a special occasion, and there‚Äôs a complaint for almost every aspect of our stay. First, the signature room that we paid more for was eerie, to say the least. The hotel opted to have very Oriental decorations for the signature rooms which are priced higher. And unless you are a fan of Oriental antiquities and dark rooms, stay clear of these rooms. The decor made my hair stand, it‚Äôs a perfect setting for a horror movie. The Hotel claim to have refurbished their rooms, yet the signature rooms were old and outdated with small, dark bathrooms and no bath tubs. Only parts of the hotel have been refurbished, and whatever they could salvage, remain, which didn‚Äôt do much for the facelift of the hotel.

Orchard Hotel Singapore,Efficient hotel,"The last time I visited was 26 years ago and not a lot has changed. The hotel has maintained its standards. The staff were helpful throughout our 9-day stay. We were able to checkin early at 10am even though they did warn us over the phone it depends on availability. There are no warm welcomes or goodbyes here, and it is jarring to those unaccustomed to Singapore. Everything is business-like, so don‚Äôt be put off. The breakfast spread was good, but it was the exact same over the 9 days we were there. The Indian food is really disappointing, but overall we were satisfied. We were traveling with a 2.5-year old.

We had a car from Changi airport and the driver and hotel staff were helpful with the luggage. We liked our room. There was adequate storage and a good bathroom. The view was not exceptional. We were hungry after our long flight and wanted a light meal. We chose to go to the upstairs restaurant and service was very slow. The drinks had to come from the bar downstairs. We got our meals but they were a little dry and unappetising. We had breakfast and dinner each evening. The choice at breakfast is mind-boggling. We chose the downstairs restaurant for dinner on subsequent evenings and opted for the a la carte menu. This was very good; substantial portions and a good choice.

Orchard Hotel Singapore,Awesome themed Signature Suite,"Do not judge a book by its cover! I was pleasantly surprised by the Signature Suite room that my friends booked me for my birthday. The themed experience began right from when the lift doors open, unveiling a ‚ÄòQing dynasty with a dash of modern‚Äô interiors along the corridors, completed with a sweet waft of fragrance in the air. The Suite itself was a nice size with access that goes all the way around the room. Access to the club lounge (that comes with the room booking) and choice of having breakfast either at the lounge or restaurant provided just that edge in guest exclusivity. It was my birthday, so a cake was almost an expected gesture from this hotel group of a behemoth, and they, of course, delivered with impeccable service no less.

Orchard Hotel Singapore,Budget hotel,"Stayed here for quarantine, would not recommend for anything, and especially not staycations. Totally does not look like pictures! I've stayed in a lot of hotels the last 2 months and this was by far the worst. Even smaller than what I stayed in in Europe (does not even have a sofa! I felt quite claustrophobic being in there 2 weeks) and room is dated in spite of supposed recent refurbishment. I suspect they included the size of the long corridor in the room size, but it's not like anyone hangs out in the corridor. If anything it's an inconvenience.  Toilet smelled even on day 1. AC does not go above 25C so if you're cold you have no choice. Asked for help, they sent a technician down who told me switch on all the lights, as light emits heat... seriously...

It is hard too not comfortable to sleep on. 4th: Going in the swimming pool, the Indian pool attendant was using the hp while on duty I presume. when we came and ask us if we made a reservation n ask us if we screenshot the reservation, I have been to so many hotel in SG this the 1st time",2 out of 5,April 2021,4.0 of 5 stars,#78 of 372 hotels in Singapore,0.03803921568627451,0.3872549019607843,51.90196078431373,38.72549019607843,3.8039215686274512,Services
