I asked for my IHG number to be added at check In, this was not done so no points, pointless complaining as staff don‚Äôt care. The breakfast is not good, too small of an area for the size of the hotel. Poor quality and not HI express standard. The rooms are small but it was clean but the a/c was rubbish.

The bathroom had one of those soap/shampoo dispenser on the wall. Don‚Äôt like the idea of washing hair and body with the same stuff. Bring your own. The big thing for me was dinner choices whilst eating on your own. Clarke quay is a very lively place with heaps of places to eat. Whilst I did it once, eating out by yourself in such a lively area is a bit uncomfortable. Unfortunately, eating at the hotel isn‚Äôt that much better.

Holiday Inn Express Singapore Clarke Quay,A good budget option for a stay in Singapore,"On our trip to Singapore, we wanted to stay at a high end hotel for the entire 10 days, but our budget didn't quite stretch to that. My husband came up with the idea of staying at 3 different hotels of varying levels of luxury, and the Holiday Inn Express was our first hotel of our trip, for 3 nights, and was intended as the budget option of the three. That said, we were impressed with the hotel, and if you are looking for a cheaper option for accommodation in Singapore, I would definitely recommend. It seems to be a fairly newly opened hotel, and the design of the whole building is impressive, on what seems to be quite a small slice of land.

The pool and hot tub area is well maintained. There are lots of places to eat nearby although it is a rather western area and it doesn‚Äôt feel like you are in Asia.

Holiday Inn Express Singapore Clarke Quay,Holiday,My partner and I stayed at the Holiday Inn Express recently and found the location of the hotel great. Behind the hotel was the river and there was a bridge across to quite a few bars and restaurants. We paid just below RM500 per night or just under ¬£100 per night which was not too bad. It was close enough to central and amenities and rooms were acceptable. Pillows were a bit soft. There was a small gym at the rooftop and a lap pool. I used the gym which was adequate but lacking in the weights and dumbbells section. Overall the experience was good given that hotels near Orchard Road were closer to the RM800 range pernight.,4 out of 5,June 2019,3.0 of 5 stars,#70 of 373 hotels in Singapore,0.03717948717948719,0.40769230769230774,51.858974358974365,40.769230769230774,3.7179487179487194,Value

Upon entering the room my partner and I could not pass each other, it reminds me off student accommodation and being in a fish bowl. If you have your suitcase on the only place to put it, you can hardly squeeze past it. The bathroom is a slide door so you can imagine how small this space is also. Breakfast was a fiasco, the first day I was shocked as there were clearly not enough seats for people to eat let along the long stressful queues for food as the space for this is tiny with 452 rooms in this hotel.

Holiday Inn Express Singapore Clarke Quay,Short and enjoyable,It was a short trip for me and my friend as my travel was very specific this time to Singapore after 5 years. Chose holiday inn express as it belongs to the IHG group which i always prefer nowadays wherever i go. Always my first priority. Good things: - check in and check out was smooth - Room was clean with a big ceiling to floor window. - They changed the room keys from plastic to Wood which i absolutely loved. (Sustainability) - The coffee shop at the lobby has a variety in coffees and cakes. - Amazing swimming pool at the rooftop. Enjoyed a quick session with all locker and bathroom facilities. - Location is great although 5-7 mins to the nearest restaurant in RIVERSIDE point of Clarke Quay. - Liked the bathroom amenities as they provided all Dove branded shampoos,4 out of 5,January 2023,3.0 of 5 stars,#70 of 373 hotels in Singapore,0.40384615384615385,0.5496794871794872,70.1923076923077,54.96794871794872,40.38461538461539,Value

Holiday Inn Express Singapore Clarke Quay,Suited our needs perfectly,"Located near Chinatown which was good for us as we were there for CNY, also close to Clarke Quay as the name would suggest and the Fort Canning MRT which was convenient for getting around the city. Without doubt the largest Holiday Inn Express we have ever stayed in which meant it was a little busy at breakfast which was free, but not unpleasant. Our room was comfortable although the bathroom was a bit small but not a problem for us and certainly not unusual for Singapore. Good free WiFi and multinational sockets which are always useful.

Only issue we had was towards the end of our stay when the aircon stopped working one evening when we returned.

Easy to do the riverwalk down to the Marina Sands and Garden By the Bay. Restaurants nearby at Clarke Quay. The buffet breakfast included in the stay was excellent. It included a variety of hot and cold items. I particularly enjoyed using the pancake machine - never seen anything like it before - but you press a button and can see your pancake batter come on a conveyor belt and then cook and come out the side onto a plate very quickly. All the staff in both the reception area and the restaurant were friendly, attentive and helpful.

Lifts are quite slow, also poor indicator lights... stairs would be so much simpler! and 3. Poor service - no one answered calls after 10pm, also no drinking water was sent despite calling the front desk... All in all, a disappointing stay.",3 out of 5,May 2023,3.0 of 5 stars,#70 of 373 hotels in Singapore,-0.14464285714285716,0.4762857142857143,42.76785714285714,47.62857142857143,14.464285714285715,Services
Holiday Inn Express Singapore Clarke Quay,Great Hotel.,Last night of a four day stay in this incredible hotel. I am a IHG member and I couldn't be more impressed with the level of service here. The staff are the real winners with service and politeness. In particular the barman War was a standout for exceptional customer service as I'm a solo traveller and he took time to chat with me and make me feel very welcome. He is an asset to this hotel. The room was perfect and the bed so comfy. The rooftop pool is a great advantage with plenty of loungers and towels.

There are a fair number of empty/closed premises close to the hotel, however there are many restaurants and shops within a 10 minute walk. There is a rooftop swimming pool at the hotel and a gym.

Holiday Inn Express Singapore Clarke Quay,Good value for money,"Really good value for money. The rooms are mosern and clean but on the small side which was perfectly fine for a weekend trip. The location is a 7min walk from the MRT (Clarke Quay or For Canning). Also good starting point for a morning walk along the river, so even though it isn't right in the middle of the action it is a good place to explore from. They have a storage room for when your flight back goes late at night and offererd to use the gym shower after check out if I needed it. The gym itself was rather small and open air type so the air was pretty warm and thick, not great for cardio.

This hotel offers all rooms with compulsory breakfast, whether you like it or not, because there is ‚ÄúNO in room dining‚Äù facility in this hotel. The walk to MRT is about 10 mins, so if it‚Äôs raining, then you need to wait for it to stop or take a cab.

Holiday Inn Express Singapore Clarke Quay,Good value hotel in great location,"Stayed here last February after a cruise. Reception were very friendly and efficient. The rooms are a little small but everything you need is there. The breakfast was a typical buffet and will be busy during peak times but the food was frequently replenished and tables cleared. There is also a small bar which serves hot drinks and cakes, snack during the day. Location is great about 10 minutes walk away from Clarks Key which for me is the ideal location. Since there are lots of bars and restaurants plus the subway and river boats. I have booked the same hotel several days next year for pre and post cruise stays so obviously I would recommend it for a combination of price, location and comfort.",5 out of 5,February 2017,3.0 of 5 stars,#70 of 373 hotels in Singapore,0.11145833333333334,0.4588541666666667,55.57291666666667,45.885416666666664,11.145833333333334,Amenities

Holiday Inn Express Singapore Clarke Quay,Really glad I stayed here...,"I stayed here for 4 nights in December 2017 during the Christmas period. I was with my family (together there were 6 adults and 1 child who was 3 years old). I am really glad we stayed here. The hotel is family friendly, looks really nice from the outside as well as the inside and provides a great breakfast. In fact I was very impressed with the breakfast selection. It was buffet style but there was a good variety from pastries, eggs, sausages, fruits and yoghurts. They also served asian food such as curry and rice on a couple of the mornings.

Hand on heart I can honestly say I preferred this hotel to the Marina Bay Sands hotel. Ok so what did I like? firstly the location.

Holiday Inn Express Singapore Clarke Quay,Great Breakfasts and well situated.,"We stayed in Beautiful Singapore to break the home trip up from England to Australia we only had 48 hours. We will definitely be going back because theirs so much more to see and do and we will also definitely be staying at the Holiday Inn Express. Its a modern, clean, well situated Hotel. The roof top pool is impressive and the food selection for their Buffet Breakfast would suit peoples tastes from all over the world, whilst also offering the tried and true fruit, cereal, bacon and eggs. I believe the the food choices change slightly everyday, as we only had two breakfasts cant be sure.

Holiday Inn Express Singapore Clarke Quay,Fantastic hotel,My wife and I stayed at this hotel on a recent 4 day trip to Singapore. We had a couple of nights here and the experience was very positive. We arrived on a very early flight and after a taxi ride straight to the hotel the staff there took care of our luggage and held it for us in a secure lock up while we had a coffee and relaxed in the comfortable reception area. Our room was ready very early and we checked in to it before 13:00. The room was quite small but very comfortable and more than adequate for a couple of nights before we moved on to a different hotel for the rest of our stay in Singapore. The free WiFi was excellent and the breakfast was one of the best buffet style breakfasts I've had. Lots of choice from different world cuisines and very comfortable tables and,5 out of 5,October 2018,3.0 of 5 stars,#70 of 373 hotels in Singapore,0.3210437710437711,0.5873569023569023,66.05218855218855,58.73569023569023,32.10437710437711,General

Holiday Inn Express Singapore Clarke Quay,A little bit too small,"The standard room for us was a tad on the small size. The bathroom is very small but the way they have layed it out is as good as it can be for the size. Our first room was looking literally on a wall of the adjacent building so we asked to move as this was too claustrophobic. We got moved to another side of the building with no wall thank goodness. The pool on the roof is quite nice though when we visited there was so much claurine in it that it literally took three trips to the shower to wash it off. Overall this feels like a 3 star hotel.

Since it is an Express property the rooms are not hugh, but are surely functional with all amenities available. The property does not have an option of rooms with king size beds and all the rooms have queen size beds, so a couple sharing bed with a child gets a bid cramped for space.

Holiday Inn Express Singapore Clarke Quay,Small Rooms.,3 night stay before heading back home to UK. We choose this hotel due to proximity to Clarkes Quay. Before I get to the main review just to note its a fair walk to Clarkes Quay from the hotel.. Its one of those trips too short for taxi and 15/20 min walking. However we progressed and walked tyne entire 2l3 days. The hotel is fairly new and the public areas are vast clean and very user friendly. This however ends when you check into your room as this must be the smallest hotel rooms ever.. Bathroom is tiny and so is the bed.. Very little room for luggage.

Even filling a small cup of water takes almost 6 seconds -No amenities like hair conditioner, front desk claimed it's due to being an Express hotel but I beg to differ as other HIEs I've stayed at before had this basic item, NOT good for women who have long hair -Gym is absolutely pathetic with no free weights, just a bench and a broken and rusty cable machine -Found two small",3 out of 5,December 2018,3.0 of 5 stars,#70 of 373 hotels in Singapore,-0.06291666666666669,0.4870833333333334,46.854166666666664,48.70833333333334,6.291666666666669,Value

Very helpful staff, a 20 metres pool, and spotlessly clean and maintained.

Holiday Inn Express Singapore Clarke Quay,Loved Our Stay Here,"What a great choice this hotel was for our short stay in Singapore. The hotel is very modern, the staff are terrific and the amenities, including a nice buffet breakfast was great. Also, the location is very central and about a 10-15 min walk to Clarke Quay for endless restaurant choices and a 7 min walk to a local convenience store. Also, there is a metro entrance near by and about a 20 min walk to Chinatown. The roof top garden area with pool and spa are awesome.
