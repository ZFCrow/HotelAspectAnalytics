The Clan Hotel by Far East Hospitality,A new & modern hotel at a superb location,Stayed in The Clan for 6 nights. It's a new hotel which is very strategically located very close to CBD & Chinatown. Telok Ayer MRT station is just 50 meters away & Raffles Park about 400 meters. Boat Quay 5 mins walk. The rooms are spacious & modern. The staff was very courteous & helpful. Breakfast is something which requires attention. There's a lack of variety & items are repetitive.

The only gripe I had was dinner at their in house restaurant, Qin, where the meal (part of the package) was not great.

It was truly one of the silliest things I have ever seen in any hotel anywhere. OK - maybe we were a bit over-tired after a long-haul flight from London - but when one wants to put the bedside lamp on so one can read without disturbing one's partner - one doesn't expect to have to then turn on the TV to scroll through pages of advertising drivel to find the instructions for a lighting console that seems more at home on the space shuttle.

The hotel is also a new kid in the block (6 months), therefore everything was relatively new and clean. Everything from check-in to the welcome tea ceremony was perfectly designed.

View was facing Chinatown, afternoon sun, but nothing the black out curtains can't do to block out the heat, if that is a concern. View was fabulous too at the 22nd level.

The Clan Hotel by Far East Hospitality,Wonderful stay at Clan,I had a very wonderful experience at the Clan including the meals (dinner and breakfast ) at Qin. Truly delightful with many twists made to the tastebuds. I was pleasantly surprised by the offer of an early check-in when Adrian from reception called me the day before to arrange. That really gave me the time to savour the room and the view that came along with it. The manager at Qin was also very personable and the staff at the restaurant were aware of our dinner booking later when we went there for the 1-for-1 sunset cocktails. The vibe is friendly. A comment for improvement: The toilet kept making some noise. We were not sure where the sensor and how to override it.

The lobby decor is carefully curated with artifacts, and builds on the original building site and its surroundings‚Äô past associations with the Chinese clans of yesteryear.
