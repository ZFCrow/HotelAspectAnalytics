The breakfast was very good. There was a lot of variety. The rooms were well done up and were quite spacious - as compared to other properties. The shuttle bus service was a boon - as we could travel to Novena MRT and to ORCHARD ROAD (Scotts Road). The people at the service desk - Check in, Concierge and all the other staff were really helpful and guided us well. Over all - will give 5 stars to the hotel - in terms of property and people.

One day we decided to check out the fitness center which was a floor below us so we took the stairs as we often do in almost every hotel we've visited in the US or internationally. It turned out that the stairwell was locked on every floor and self locked behind us too. There was no way out. No amount of yelling could be heard through the double sealed doors. It was very hot and suffocating, we were scared with the lack of response to yelling and banging on walls. After a while we were dizzy from the heat, very thirsty and very concerned.

The best functional hotel which has great pros in terms of local coach connectivity to Metro Station, Little India, public transport to all the Tourist attractions.The best thing about the location is the adjoining mall with the eclectic food court and grocery store.

Aloft Singapore Novena,Happy with the stay,"We had searched for quite a few hotels at Agoda & Booking for something that would fit our needs. We were keen on a safe (although SG is generally mentioned as safe everywhere) but we were still wanting to be sure. This one was a little beyond our budget but we decided on it after we read a recommendation on a blog. Overall the experience was nice. We expected the room to be a little larger though. There were some minor issues with the first room that we got (our room was changed after we saw some bugs - they claimed it was ""just some ants"" that got attracted to the fruits) especially with the washroom, such as not enough slant on the floor of the shower area for the water to drain off, malfunctioning accent light on one side of the bed.

Aloft Singapore Novena,Not so nice and too expensive for what you get.,"We came in at night and check in was fairly quick. The only thing the receptionist forgot to tell us, is that you also have to use your roomcard in the elevator, otherwise the elevator won't move. Kind of annoying if you aren't told this in the night. The room is small but has everything you need. The rooms are quiet, you don't hear anyone walking in the hallway because of the carpet. We requested a room on a high floor so we have a nice view of the city. We got a room on the 4th floor... view horrible. The poolarea is not so nice place and the sun loungers are sagging.

For rooms with a bath tub, the hotel will charge an additional of $23.54 nett and this is payable during check in/out.

The light switch all looked dirty and could be better wiped since these are touchpoints to consider. Also the cupboard door, fridge cupboard door and drawers opening door could also be further clean. Can see that these areas need to be very much looked into. Since this hotel is relatively new i am puzzled as to why there are dust particles flying around. It is literally everywhere and very visible - lift lobbies, carpeted areas, rooms. 3. As for dining, there is not much choice of food as the restaurant caters mostly to chinese cuisine.
