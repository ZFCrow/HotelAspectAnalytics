My husband and I have a preference for windows, so if you are booking these rooms be thoughtful that spaces are engineered for your necessities not for spending time inside. Therefore my only request was to have windows and I was certainly happy about this - my small room had two! I was well impressed by the bathroom too - in other hotels.

Hotel G Singapore,Hotel G for a day use stopover,Hotel G was the best option for our 24 hour stop-over for linking flights out of Changi. The room we initially booked was very small so we opted to pay another $55 on top of the $185 for a bigger room. It was a durables room with 4 extra square meters of space. The alternative was to pay $140 dollars on top of the $185 for a suite. That would have been the better option. The disabled room has a very short double bed that is hard to access for one party. It has a shower head at a height for a wheelchair customer only and it has no black-out curtains. It is noisy too from wheels on hard surfaces with little sound damping.It has a really great restaurant /bistro downstairs with a really nice included breakfast. It dies not have a pool.

The housekeeping staff, Ras in particular, were very efficient and helpful.

Some reviews have complained about noisy neighbours, but the only time we ever heard people outside our room was briefly in the corridor outside. Nobody was ever so noisy that we couldn‚Äôt sleep. Space is at a premium in Singapore and Hotel G have done their best to make their rooms comfortable in a limited space.

Hotel G Singapore,An overall terrible experience,Pros: - soft bed - decent location Cons: - The shower floods the entire bathroom every time the shower is on for more than 15 seconds because the floor is not sloped towards the drain and there‚Äôs nothing blocking the water. It becomes necessary to use all towels in the room to mop up the floor - Bathroom and parts of hotel smell of mold or mildew - Lots of noise from outside and inside. Strange popping noise from windows at random times often waking me up. Noisy AC (the hotel fixed this after complaining). Loud doors that slam shut ensure you wake up along with the first person on your floor. - Air conditioning behaves strangely. I kept AC at 20 at all times but sometimes it would become very cold or hot over night,1 out of 5,August 2023,3.5 of 5 stars,#75 of 372 hotels in Singapore,0.006190476190476175,0.5125,50.3095238095238,51.24999999999999,0.6190476190476175,Cleaniness

The room was well air conditioned (bonus!) Great location, I felt very safe. Con: The sheets made me itch throughout the night. There were random hairs found on my bedding & when I looked through the snack box, there were hairs along the bottom (gross). Breakfast was an extra surcharge and honestly not with it. The halls were humid and had a moldy smell to it! The walls were paper thin, heard noises all hours of the night. Overall the cons are just suggestions to improve the overall quality of guests stays.

The breakfast was okay for me but if you are looking for different things to eat, there are restaurants at the hotel and across the street.

Breakfast well below average and was often all gone by 09.30am. Saying that on the last day they were restocking at 10.00am, so perhaps someone had complained.

Hotel G Singapore,"Small, clean, and good location",Stayed in early November. Our room was on 7th floor and was very small but practical. The hotel is situated less than a quarter mile from the nearest MRT. Below the hotel and is a burger joint which is bustling at night. The same burger joint also serves as the breakfast buffet. Breakfast was decent with a combination of western and local offerings. One minor gripe with room is that the sink sits outside the bath/toilet and located in the entry way. This felt a bit odd.

Hotel G Singapore,Small but good value rooms,The hotel is in a great central location and close to MRT stations. The staff were friendly and helpful. The rooms are very well equipped and the sound proofing is good. I got a good night‚Äôs sleep. The breakfast was extensive. Very good selection. The only negatives were the lack of a light switch near to the bed - it was hard to find the light switch in the middle of the night - and the rooms are very small. It was almost claustrophobic for one person. I would not have wanted to inhabit it with two people in the room. You would be bumping into each other and one person would have to climb over the other to get out of bed.,3 out of 5,December 2019,3.5 of 5 stars,#75 of 372 hotels in Singapore,0.17728070175438596,0.5197368421052633,58.8640350877193,51.97368421052633,17.728070175438596,General

Not just the contents of the minibar, but the complete fridge. No, you can not chill your own water either.

As usual, the room was clean and cozy, all the room amenities were well equipped. Kudos to the housekeeping staff whose name was called ""Shah"". He was really friendly and dedicated to his job. We were on the way to our room and we saw him cleaning the room next door. Hence, we asked him to get us some bath amenities since they were almost finished and he did. Other than that, as a courtesy, he reconfirmed with us that if we really didnt want to clean the room (as we placed a ""No Thanks"" tag on the door knob).

The ambience was great, the music was jazzy and the overall design was modern and classy.

Hotel G Singapore,Excellent,"Stayed a night at G Hotel on a Saturday. Was greeted and served by Bella. Genuine and professional, she clarified my doubts with ease and made me feel very welcomed to the Hotel. Check-in was smooth, quick and easy. Even got a free upgrade to the king size bed room. Room is small but it is cozy and clean. TV channels were limited but it has an HDMI input to stream your laptop or other devices. Hotel location is convenient with many food outlets available in the vicinity. Only downside to the room is that there is no mini bar fridge. Overall, very happy with my stay.

Hotel G Singapore,Affordable stay at an artsy place,"Second time staying here, always very intrigued by the giant dream catcher in the room. However, the dream catcher in my room this time was a bit uglier and plainer than the first (the first had feathers). Room wise, it‚Äôs an affordable stay hence room size is small. It‚Äôs still manageable even though the bed is fitted tightly at the corner which means one of the guests would have a hard time going to the toilet in the middle of the night. Service wise, we had a warm welcome by manager Darryl, a much kinder greeting than our first stay. He allowed us early check in, likely since it was a Friday so there might have more available rooms.

I was surprised to see that biggest room was offered to me at the price of $90 . This room was not included in the list of room available for booking for the day. However, I decided to skip all the F&B offers , like Burger in Bed, and other tempting snacks like "" chicken wings, ice cream tubes' because I need to watch my diet. On the day of check in, check in was effortless and no complimentary check out was offered. Went to 8 storey and check in single room.

The most basic package is $100 - you don't need to fork out cash to top up. I.e. You can spend your cash on good food. 2. The rooms are small but the service is great. The rooms are small, about 15-17 sqm, but I don't feel suffocated. The same can't be said for bigger rooms I stayed in other hotels in SG and overseas. The rooms are nicely and uniquely designed, unlike many business hotels with generic rooms. The mattress they use is serta, so it's very nice to sleep on.

Hotel G Singapore,Pleasant stay,"Reception & Drop off located at level 2 accessible via carpark as well. We were informed in advance that our check-in would be after 4pm instead of 3pm. Appreciate the early notice and their efforts to stagger the arrivals of guests, as it would be rather annoying to arrive at 3pm and having to wait with so many guests queuing for the check-in at the lobby. Staff from front desk were hardworking, and despite the rather long queues of incoming guests, tried to address enquiries from guests without being seeming too hurried. Hema processed our check-in and she was meticulous in the documents and patiently explained the SMM protocols which were very important to everyone. Daryl was extremely friendly, empathetic and thoughtful.

Hotel G Singapore,Perfect 3D2N Staycation!,"Stayed in this hotel last weekend, purchased the 3D2N deal using the SRV voucher with plenty of perks to enjoy. Check-in was a breeze, friendly and helpful associates explaining every detail. Room was super cozy, A/C, shower water pressure and hot water was perfect. Water tends to splash out despite having a shower curtain but not a deal breaker. Loved the complimentary champagne too. Pillows were a bit too thin though. Burgers from 25 Degrees (package) were so good, they weren't scrimping with the patty sizes. Preferred the Number One over the Number Two. Dined at Ginett and used the F&B dining voucher. Olio Scampi was a tad bland, but the prawns were juicy. Wine vouchers (from spotting difference in lift doors) were used, and was great too.
