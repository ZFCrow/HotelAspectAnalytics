"PARKROYAL COLLECTION Marina Bay, Singapore",A great location in the heart of Singapore,"We thoroughly enjoyed our stay at The Park Royal Marina Bay. The building is phenomenal, the rooms are a great size and pristine. The facilities such as the lobby are exceptional. The location was perfect we could enjoy the view of Marina bay sands and take in the rest of the incredible Singapore skyline from the pool area. My only disappointment was the service we experienced. Staff at reception and at the pool bar, in our experience at least were not the most welcoming and helpful. At the pool bar, it felt like the staff didn’t want to serve us and weren’t very attentive to us or anyone else. Our experience with the reception staff at check in was very blunt and not overly welcoming.

"PARKROYAL COLLECTION Marina Bay, Singapore",Great hotel in perfect location for sightseeing in Singapore,Beautiful hotel. Lovely rooms. Worth paying the extra for the ‘club collection’ level.

But it is advertised/presented as being a little nicer than it actually is. Location Great location close to Marina Bay and all that is on offer- plus within 5-10min walking of several MRT stations. If you like malls, there are like 3 all right next door or attached. We walked to many areas from here (even in the heat) and enjoyed exploring nearby. Property The building lobby is shared but is nice/welcoming. You go up to the 4th floor for the hotel lobby which is beautiful. The garden in a hotel vibe is well done and the place feels open, unique, charming.

However, on my last stay, I was extremely disappointed when my visit came to an end and I discovered that the Parkroyal Collection at Marina Bay in Singapore did not accept a ""Tap and Go"" credit card as payment. As a result of this deficiency I had to use another credit card that cost me foreign currency conversion fees and therefore increased the cost of my stay. This situation is exarcebated by my experience in Vietnam immediately afterwards where even small traders have no problem with ""Tap and Go"".

"PARKROYAL COLLECTION Marina Bay, Singapore","Nice hotel, Poor service, not a 5 star experience","My wife & I booked a room at the Park Royal Collection Hotel in Marina Bay to celebrate our Anniversary. This was our 1st trip to Singapore and we had read many positive reviews of the hotel. Our actual experience during our stay however fell well short of our expectation for a 5 star hotel at this price range, mostly because of the poor service in the main entrance from the bell hops & doormen. On the positive side, the hotel itself is beautiful inside, the rooms spacious with modern amenities and our Marina Bay view was pretty spectacular with a large balcony. The king size bed, pillows & linens were extremely comfortable. The bathroom was pretty spacious though the shower is very cramped for 2 people.

"PARKROYAL COLLECTION Marina Bay, Singapore",A lovely stay for the Grand Prix,"Our stay was seven nights over the Grand Prix week and overall it was a great experience. The interior of the hotel is beautifully designed with a lush indoor garden and even domesticated birds that add to the ambience. It seems that the rooms have recently been renovated, and we appreciated the plentiful storage space, lighting options and a great bathroom layout that included practical things like a retractable clothesline, unlimited filtered water tap and a large countertop. These 'everyday' things can make a huge difference to how pleasant a stay is. When staying here during Grand Prix week it's good to keep in mind that the roads around the hotel are part of the track and are closed from the Wednesday prior to the race.

Since it was New Year’s Eve crossing into New Year’s Day, I had a unique experience at this hotel for our staycation. Firstly, the hotel comes across to me as a hotel catered more to businesses and for adults instead of family. Every upgrade or room or even an additional child bed comes with an exorbitant price. Even to bring a guest for coffee or cocktail to the lounge comes with an extra charge. Having travelled widely and stayed with many hotels by various organisations.

My husband and I stayed at the Park Royal Marina Bay as part of our honeymoon trip. We spent 2 nights here before moving on to Thailand. We absolutely loved the hotel and wished we had been able to stay longer. From the moment we entered it felt grand and luxurious. Our room did not disappoint either. We booked a room with a view of the Marina Bay Sands and it was simply magical! I could have sat and watched the view all night! The food was excellent as were the drinks and the service was exceptional. Watching the robot trolleys coming from the kitchen was quite an experience! Highly recommend this wonderful hotel - hopefully we can return one day!,5 out of 5,January 2023,5.0 of 5 stars,#20 of 372 hotels in Singapore,0.4287591575091575,0.6897252747252748,71.43795787545788,68.97252747252747,42.87591575091575,Services

"PARKROYAL COLLECTION Marina Bay, Singapore",Great hotel & location,My husband and I booked Park Royal Collection Marina Bay our travel agent for our sons wedding and were very pleasantly surprised upon arrival! We had asked for a hotel near Marina Bay and paid for an upgrade from Clark Quay - and must say this location and quality for the price point is amazing. Front service is on 4th floor (unusual) but their service was quick and attentive and they agreed for us to have 1 hour extended late checkout which is kind of them. Cleaning was quick everyday after we left green light to clean when we left for the day - be sure to tip cleaners as they do an exceptional job. The pictures online are quite extreme but when you see the surrounding trees/gardens flowers and hear the birds it is really very peaceful and beautiful.

The interior has spectacular architecture with a garden and birds that sing discreetly in the morning. Special mention must go to the wonderful Melvin Mong, Duty Manager, who made every effort to ensure our comfort and well being. Also the lovely Ali the concierge who was so helpful with our questions. I highly recommend this hotel. Thank you for making our stay a memorable one.",5 out of 5,March 2023,5.0 of 5 stars,#20 of 372 hotels in Singapore,0.30756493506493504,0.5320887445887446,65.37824675324674,53.208874458874455,30.756493506493506,Amenities
"PARKROYAL COLLECTION Marina Bay, Singapore",Great service,The hotel has easily lived up to the 5 star rating. We arrived early and they were able to get us into our room. From arriving the staff have been pleasant and accommodating throughout. The room is spacious and more than enough for us for our 4 day visit. The hotel with its atrium and open spaces is impressive. We have been made felt welcome and comfortable the whole time. More than happy to book in again next time we are in Singapore.,5 out of 5,March 2023,5.0 of 5 stars,#20 of 372 hotels in Singapore,0.4261904761904762,0.6303571428571428,71.30952380952381,63.035714285714285,42.61904761904762,General
