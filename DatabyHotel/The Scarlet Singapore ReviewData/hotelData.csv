The Scarlet Singapore,Great Cinatown Location,"When I booked in March , I became aware that the 5 days I needed to stay in Singapore was durng F1 week which explained the high hotel rates even 6 months out, and the limited availability. At the time of booking, all that was available was an interior room (without window). On arrival, I was very happy to be allocated a room with a very small balcony and windows. Pros: * Location is in Chatatown, directly opposite the new Maxwell MRT * Within short walking distance to Maxwell, Amoy & Chinatown Food Centres, and within 5 minutes of Amoy Street where there are many restaurants (should you tire of food centres) * Hotel room has a small refidgerator with free beverages (soft drinks, Coconut water, and Tiger beers), These are topped up daily as are te chocolate bars and packets of",4 out of 5,September 2023,4.0 of 5 stars,#18 of 372 hotels in Singapore,0.16428107606679035,0.40410018552875693,58.21405380333952,40.41001855287569,16.428107606679035,Location

The Scarlet Singapore,Great location,"I recently stayed at the Scarlet Hotel, on the very edge of Chinatown. There are many things that make this hotel a great place to stay. First and foremost is it's incredible location, being right next to Chinatown, and also Club Street, which is packed with cosy bars and restaurants and has a quaint old colonial street appeal. The interior decor of the hotel is loaded with character, and my room was very comfortable and clean. It's worth choosing a premier room as you have windows that open onto a tiny balcony, and this lends a sense of a bit more space than the other smaller rooms. The staff are delightful and extremely helpful. You cannot fault the service here. My main complaint, if anything, was the quality of the breakfast provided, which costs around $30 but is absolutely",3 out of 5,September 2018,4.0 of 5 stars,#17 of 372 hotels in Singapore,0.2517748917748918,0.5171536796536796,62.588744588744596,51.71536796536797,25.177489177489182,Location

The Scarlet Singapore,My Favourite Quirky Hotel Singapore,"We stayed one night before flying out of Singapore. This gorgeous hotel in a row of heritage converted shophouses has a sloping hallway, half floors and a roof top terrace. The staff and service are lovely, breakfast was nice and the room whilst very small, was comfortable and clean, the bathroom is large and lovely. I know that the rooms are all different. Location is fabulous, across the road from genuine Singapore Hawkers market, end of the street is Chinatown.

The Scarlet Singapore,Location & Price equals value.,"What was I worried about before booking at the Scarlett? The location was right side of city for cruise port and within Chinatown where we hadn't been before. We had secured early a good price on Wotif. We liked the idea of the heritage of the converted shop houses. Some reviews mentioned lack of a window. So we asked by email before arriving and were granted one. If we weren't granted one, multiple lights on dimmer switches. Some reviews how small the standard room. There was a trestle for one suitcase and I stored mine in the dead space between front door and bathroom door. Mention of a tired bathroom. Sure some mildew on grout and sealant, but a good shower with good volume of flow. I liked the bathroom, compact and functional. It rained the first morning.

I can only agree with the previous reviews, the Scarlet hotel does not meets international standards and also not the promised category. It is also not a boutique hotel at all in my point of view. The service is extremely bad and poor. And as other guests already stated in their ratings here before. When you complain, you actually get silly and cheeky answers. 1.)

The Scarlet Singapore,Disappointed.,"On our previous stay we enjoyed the Executive Room with Balcony; especially the balcony were we sat evenings absorbing the sounds, scents and sensations of Singapore. That is why I chose to re-book the same accommodation, well in advance. We arrived at the Scarlet mid-afternoon, tired, having travelled since the previous morning, and were asked to wait. Eventually I made enquiries and was told that we had been up-graded to the Suite which was being prepared. So we waited some more. Our suite was large, comfortable, over-looking an intersection and more stylish (to the point of being almost garish). But NO balcony.

The Scarlet Singapore,"Still an interesting hotel but off its game, and got a WINDOWLESS ROOM","I liked the Scarlet when it first opened more than a decade ago, stayed a couple of times: it was lush, decadent and polished. I stayed again for 2 nights recently and it's still got great bones but it doesn't seem as tightly run, or polished, and the rates, and the operation itself, have drifted downmarket a bit. I would have given it 3.5 or 4 stars but the hotel committed the cardinal sin of putting me in a windowless room (contrary to my expectations). That's just not on. Let me be clear: there's nothing wrong with a hotel offering windowless rooms, but they need to match them to guests who are happy to stay in them (perhaps for a lower price). It's about disclosure.

The Scarlet Singapore,Average at best,"There were a few things about this hotel that was not as expected, firstly check in and out was not as good as it could be, on check out we just got a ""your all set"" no thank you for your stay or even was it a good stay. I also noticed that the guest checking in next to us were given a cold towel and drink, which we didn't get offered. The location of the hotel is central, although what you don't see in the pictures is that the opposite side of the street is under construction and not the prettiest to look at. We had a executive room with balcony, it was VERY small, best for one person, you cannot pass at the same time at the end of the bed easily and the balcony you're pretty much sitting next to your neighbour, the other downside is the noise that you get from the road behind",3 out of 5,May 2018,4.0 of 5 stars,#17 of 372 hotels in Singapore,0.09907407407407409,0.4075925925925926,54.9537037037037,40.75925925925926,9.907407407407408,General

We upgraded to an ‘executive’ room when we found out the deluxe room had no window.

One had to walk into the shower to be able to close the door! No room service after the associated restaurant closed (at 9:45pm). The desk staff have no knowledge of any events such as the Rugby Sevens. No concierge; basically, no service. The hotel corridors are dark and dingy. The rooms are terrible.

The Scarlet Singapore,Very Obliging,We stayed here for two nights. Hotel is 10 minutes walk from Chinatown metro of S$10 Taxi from downtown. Very obliging Reception staff and bellboy. Lena the receptionist provides service with smile and very obliging when we requested a change of room. Room was well furnished with tea and coffee making facilities but quite small with no space for two suitcases. The double bed was comfortable but too narrow. Bathroom was modern and large enough to store a suitcase. We had breakfast and dinner on the on-site restaurants and were quite satisfied with the standard.

But the hotel staff’s ready to get you a cab anytime. But what we really loved about this hotel is that while it’s just nearby busy food centers, it’s perfectly located away from the hustle and",5 out of 5,October 2017,4.0 of 5 stars,#17 of 372 hotels in Singapore,0.21726190476190474,0.4398809523809524,60.863095238095234,43.98809523809524,21.726190476190474,Location
The Scarlet Singapore,Filthy Hotel,"Stayed only one night and happy didn't have to stay longer because the hotel is dingy filthy and cramped. The bathroom was disgusting hair everywhere, soap scum, mildew grout with 1/4inch build up of mold. Rooms are tiny constantly hitting my shin on the bed ends so left with some bruise souvenirs. Noise level was bad where the french doors to the outside we're not even close to being sound proofing in any way which also limited the ability of the Air-conditioning in 90+ weather. The bar tender is super rude, Italian lady just the worse never went back for a drink actually ordered drinks planing on taking a seat but instead ran and ducked for cover in my room with two drinks.

It is well located. Sadly in recent time the food and bar have been let out with a stupid system of dual vouchers - one for the hotel account and the other for the lessee. Breakfast is expensive at 26 Sdollars, plus, for a buffet of watered flavourless juices and a large display of uninteresting food. Eggs have to be ordered seperately. There is little fresh fruit, no tea pots etc etc the most appalling dry white bread to toast , no croissants or containers to take jam from the bulk jam jars and the yogurt is far too funny - no body :-( The hotel rooms are quite pleasant and roomy.

The Scarlet Singapore,nice change from the usual hotel chains,hotel is very close to Chinatown and is in an old shop building or something like that. Rooms are not big but are beautifully decorated and we had a little balcony with French doors out (although not much room to open the door). It's great as a place to sleep but not good if you want somewhere to laze around during the day. the lift was out while we were there which meant we had to use the fire escape spiral staircase to our room.

To be remembered by hotel staff is a rarity these days, and we treasure it.

It was billed as ""deluxe"". It was not. It was nearly at the end of a very long corridor (no problem with that) but it had almost zero natural light - no windows at all.

The Scarlet Singapore,Quirky,"We loved this hotel, but not sure it would be to everyone's taste. The decoration is beautiful, the staff helpful, the room small but very comfortable with lots of extras. Only tried the rooftop bar and the staff were delightful, definitely recommend the limoncello. It was our anniversary and we got a lovely card and present. One of the positives of this hotel is its location. China town, Maxwell Food court all on its doorstep.

Erskine Road is one of a dozen protected streets in the centre of the mega glass skyline. These road are full of character and hint towards yesteryear before the explosion of modernity that is Singapore. As you check into the hotel, you're struck by the burlesque decor, water fountains and decadent lobby. No expense has been spared with chairs too cool to sit on and the glass chandelier hanging between the mirrored circle that delights and confuses in equal measure. The front desk staff are welcoming.

The Scarlet Singapore,Quaint Boutique Hotel,"This defines Boutique hotel combining affordability with comfort and style. It reminds me of an Ian Schraeger property in New York City ( the Paramont). First, my booking was last minute which made the price seem like a bargain especially for Singapore. That's how come I ended up with a windowless room which I don't necessarily recommend unless your nocturnal. The room was bigger than average size for Asia. But most important to me was the bed was comfortable. I find in Asia the beds to be too firm but not here. I understand that they even have a special bed in the more expensive rooms.

The Scarlet Singapore,Fabulous hotel in a great location,"Stayed here for two nights recently with my sister. Reception area is beautifully decorated and staff were efficient and always friendly. Our room was located on the second floor and was beautifully decorated with a small balcony. Room size was small but given you are in a converted shophouse, this is is to be expected. Little touches such as the earplugs & mobile phone were fabulous. I was concerned by other posts regarding noise but neither of us needed to use the ear plugs. Hotel location is fabulous, 30 second walk to Maxwell Road Food Centre and close to Chinatown Food St. The only consideration would be if you were a larger sized person - the bathroom was very small and the using the toilet would be difficult as you need to go in on an angle.

We were pleasantly surprised: the noise was no issue and the room was spacious and comfortable. Luckily, we had also requested a balcony. This was a good size and we spent many evenings there. Although the balcony overlooked a multi-storey car park, it was actually interesting to watch the coming and goings throughout the day. The car park was in fact part of the URA building, the Urban Redevelopment Authority. This motivated us to visit the free URA exhibition. I cannot here go into detail, but it was fascinating and well worth a visit. The rooftop bar of the hotel is incredibly popular, but spacious enough to accommodate a large number of guests.

Why look at another brick wall or building site.

Worst of all, it wasn't properly communicated to the front desk, and we woke up on the day of check out expecting that it was open and we should be going for our treatment. Front desk checked on the website and it was supposed to be opened on the 3rd day of CNY.

Secondly, the bath robes are too small for me and when I requested a robe that fits, my request was met with deafening silence. They offer tea but without milk.

Even the ""do not disturb"" door sign has captions printed along the lines: shush, we are being naughty right now. The check-in process was uninspiring to say the least.

The Scarlet Singapore,Amazing!,Location is great being next to Chinatown and food is plentiful. 2 metro stations within 5 minute walk. We can't praise the Scarlet Hotel enough. From check in Jenny was so accommodating allowing us a late check out. We booked the deluxe room. The room was small but sufficient for our stay. The bed was very comfortable and pillows were perfect. Our check out day we had issues with our airline and the staff at Scarlet were incredible. Allowing us to call Australia to try sort out the issue. Ronnie the door man was quick on the bags and after our dinner in town Eugene was once again there to help out.

I booked the Passion Suite for an anniversary surprise, being drawn by the outside space and hot tub on the balcony. What we hadn't been advised of was the major construction overlooking the balcony, which is not the fault of the hotel, but we should have been told about it. Instead there was a note next to the bed containing two sets of ear plugs. This should have set alarm bells off.

This hotel used to be a row of single story shops going up Erskine Road and when you walk along the corridor you walk down or up the incline of the road from or to the fabulous lobby. Our room was stunning. The interiors are decorated with an Art Deco feel and use very sexy colours & textures. The reception and conceits staff were amazing too.

We were low down the hill and the noise from the building works and the refuse moving at 5.00am was very loud. Strange glass door to bathroom and frosted glass therein meant early light into the room. Breakfast was very basic and poorly laid out in the non too cosy evening restaurant.

The Scarlet Singapore,Don't be Fooled by the Faux Moulin Rouge Look - this is excellent!,"I use the Scarlet every time I have to travel on business to Singapore, and the location in Chinatown is v. convenient for the business area.

Frankly, I stash my stuck up arrogant (American) clients in the Fullerton and flee to the Scarlet to enjoy the outdoor dining at Breeze and the brilliant Italian cuisine below, not to mention all the Malaysian, Singaporean and Indonesian cafeteria style shops in the neighborhood.

The Scarlet Singapore,Colourful Friendly Hotel,The name of the hotel reveals its design style with vivid pinks & reds dominating in the décor. It was a bit over powering at first but does fit in with the hotel style.

It was comfortable with a good sized bed and a reasonable bathroom. Beware of the bed legs though as these are made of very solid hardwood which is unforgiving on feet.

The Scarlet Singapore,Bit of a mixed bag,"The location is good if you want to be near Chinatown and it's opposite the Maxwell, one of the best food courts in Singapore. The building is lovely - a run of converted shophouses with superb lobby area, evoking earlier times. There's no pool but there is an outdoor hot tub which accommodates 4 although they'd need to be pretty good friends. Rooms however are very claustrophobic - tiny and dark. We got one with a balcony but it looked out onto a multi storey car park and there was no screening from the next door balcony. Cleaning was erratic at best and all the accommodation seemed a little shabby and worn out. Our bathroom window which opened out onto the pool patio deck would not even shut properly, never mind lock so it was difficult to sleep soundly.

The Scarlet Singapore,Great Start to our Honeymoon,Stayed for a total of 5 nights in a premium room. Found the location to be excellent and we could often walk or catch a taxi for under $10 to anywhere we wanted to travel. Didn't try the hotel breakfast but found a local cafe only 5 mins away (Sarnies) to have excellent coffee. Room was filled with plush furniture and trimmings. We also had an all inclusive mini bar (snacks). The bed was firm and pillows soft - which wasn't to my wife's liking but very much to my liking. There was a smell from the bathroom that occurred occasionally - it dissipated quickly enough that we didn't feel the need to complain to hotel staff.

The Scarlet Singapore,Not quirky enough to be different nor the amenities to be mainstream,I've stayed in Singapore a number of times and this time we thought it would be nice to stay somewhere a little different from the mainstream large hotels. The premise of the Scarlet as converted merchant houses / shops right by Chinatown seemed really promising. The standard rooms are fairly small which was expected but have very little in the way of natural light which is indirect and thus it feels a bit like being in a bunker rather than a room. There is minimal storage for clothes in the way of drawers or even hangars (4!).

Although we did have them, they were very small, but if I'm being honest it didn't really affect us that much. The entrance was lovely and the staff were very helpful and friendly. Check out was at 12pm and our flight wasn't until the evening, the hotel looked after our baggage whilst we had a wonder around and we were also able to use the shower facilities to refreshen up before we left for the airport, which was a real bonus. We tried out the gym on both days, it is small and basic but it was fine",4 out of 5,January 2016,4.0 of 5 stars,#17 of 372 hotels in Singapore,0.2240589569160998,0.46684807256235833,61.20294784580499,46.684807256235835,22.40589569160998,General
The Scarlet Singapore,Quick stay,I have stayed at this hotel a number of times for business travel. Stayed with my wife this time. We were there for NYE event. I enjoy this boutique motel as it is quite with friendly staff. Also is is next to Chinatown which is fun to walk through. Staff has always been friendly and accommodating.

The Scarlet Singapore,Stylish boutique hotel in Chinatown close to Maxwell Road Hawker Centre,"Standard rooms can be quite small as hotel is converted shop-houses but they have some larger suites which are quite opulent. Position on edge of Chinatown is great with Maxwell Hawker Centre just across the way, the Tong Heng bakery with their superb custard tarts just round the corner, the bars and restaurants of Ann Siang Road close by, and Smith Street and the heart of Chinatown a few hundred metres away. They have a couple of good Italian restaurants in house (one on the roof) and serve good cocktails in the bar in Casa Tartufo. Rooftop one recently refurbished.

The Scarlet Singapore,Not told about the 50$ deposit charge per night,I chose The Scarlet Hotel after reading reviews here on Tripadvisor. I can confirm other reviews that state the friendliness of the staff and that the rooms were very comfortable but on the small side. We were upgraded to a Delux Room apon arrival (dont know why) which had two very big windows both of which were sealed closed. The bathroom is very small and the water pressure wasn´t that great but sufficient. The TV channels were satisfactory too with Fox Movies and a few other english speaking channels. The hotel is very long indeed and runs along almost the whole of Erskine Road with Reception being at the end of the road from the main road. There are no other entrances or exists than from the Reception.

I booked an executive suite with a balcony. To use the toilet one would have to sit side saddle. The rooms are small though clean. The balcony overlooks a service Ali which is very noisy and ear plugs are recommended if you are going to stay here. Another problem is the water drains very slowly. I did call down to the desk about that and they showed me that it would eventually drain out. The shower is spacious and every time leaks water throughout the bathroom. I don't see what the attraction is here with the colors. I would absolutely not stay here again.,2 out of 5,November 2015,4.0 of 5 stars,#17 of 372 hotels in Singapore,-0.05867063492063493,0.4600396825396825,47.06646825396825,46.00396825396825,5.867063492063493,Cleaniness
The Scarlet Singapore,Great location and lovely boutique hotel,Unfortunately only had one night to spend at this lovely little hotel that is perfectly positioned for Chinatown & Club St. Beautiful lobby decked out in velvet. Room was well appointed and very clean. Aircon was lovely and cold. Roof top bar served nice cocktails although $$. Only criticism was that we weren't told at check in about the bar or cafe on site.

The Scarlet Singapore,Not a modern soulless hotel,"A pot luck choice made prior to our visit to Singapore - and the choice was very good. Located on the edge of Chinatown, the old building is rather overshadowed by newer skyscrapers. Friendly staff at reception ensured formalities were quickly completed. The room was fairly compact, but with a large, recently upgraded bathroom. The bedroom included a fridge with complimentary beer, soft drinks, chocolate and a bottle of red wine. There was also a good sized safe and fast Wi-Fi. The air on was able to combat the Singapore heat and humidity.

The Scarlet Singapore,Awesome Experience,"So I was interested to see hw this hotel would be. In a historical Building, it has a setting that reminds you of Asia in the 60's. Until you get inside, then it feels like you were transported to an Agatha Christie Novel set in the Orient. You feel the ambience as you go. Now for more practical. The rooms are nice, they are each unique. Nice comfy bed with some firmness, free refillable minibar. But what makes this place even better, is the staff, Unbelievably friendly, helpful and went way beyond to help me out when I needed a place to do some recording with a friend. Offered up suggestions and help, even when not asked, and even the regular cleaning staff were very friendly and outgoing, which is a bit unusual from most who say hi and bow their heads.

The Scarlet Singapore,Lovely stay at Scarlet hotel!,We stayed at the Scarlet hotel for 2 nights as a stop over in Singapore before a holiday in Bali. We loved the hotel and is in perfect location next to Chinatown and only 30 minute walk to marina bay sands. We loved the roof top bar on top of hotel which we were given complimentary drink vouchers for on arrival. Mini bar in room too was completely free with snacks and refreshments. The service of the staff was the highlight of this hotel. They were very attentive and informative during our stay. We had an unfortunate panic at the airport where we realised we left a bag behind with passport in!!

The Maxwell Food Centre is just a couple of minutes walk away while the F&B heaven of Telok Ayer area is just across the Ann Siang Park. The interior of the hotel may be daunting to some with scarlet walls and warm lighting. The corridor was like a never ending maze. My room was at the far end of the hotel.

A bonus of a window facing out the back was good and the room functional with no complaints apart for the being noisy with noise from both sides and music on rooftop till late on. Of course location was good. A free drinks voucher was offered for the upstairs bar after 5pm. We arrived at 5:30 on a Sunday night to be told we could drink and order food but would have to depart by 6pm !!! As they had a private function on.

The Scarlet Singapore,Comfortable Stay at Well Located Heritage Property (with one caveat),"Stayed 3 nights at The Scarlet Hotel Singapore in a Premium room. The room was located on the floor above street level and had large windows which allowed much natural light. We recommend requesting a room with windows for this room category. We checked in earlier and although the room (233) was ready we were charged an early check in fee of $S178, which we thought was excessive. Despited this initial issue we loved the overall heritage ambience of the property and were pleased to read in other reviews that there is a refurbisment planned for next year. The furnishings are a little ""faded and jaded"" with some stained and lifting carpets. However the hotel still maintains that heritage character and appeal.

So overall a good choice. However, if you pay the extra for a room with a balcony and breakfast, mind the following. Avoid at all cost the tienest balcony room they have, room 207 where using the toilet is a challenge. As to breakfast, it starts at 07:45.

Lumpy and just a sheet directly on the mattress; No sheet, just a doona... I want a top sheet as well as a doona. Breakfast included - expected a full buffet, but just a few poor choices a la carte. The first morning a slice of white toast with a single slice of ham and a bit of scrambled egg. Second morning a dessert glass with a tiny amount of yoghurt and cereal. Hardly enough to sustain an adult. The hotel is getting a bit tatty, broken door handles, chipped paint, and tables in the rooftop bar have peeling stickers on them. Yuk. Sand and restain them!

The Scarlet Singapore,Amazing staff - hotel less so,"Location in Chinatown is excellent and easy to get to other locations on foot or public transport. However, we upgraded our room after we found our Deluxe room to be way too small for an 8 night stay. Even then, there were some odd things. I understand that hotels need to maximise use of space but, couldn't open shower door completely as it hit the toilet. AND the ""3"" rating is NOT a reflection on the staff. They deserve a 5. Housekeeping and desk staff were amazingly helpful especially Vino, Hari & Joscelyn. Disappointed that ongoing renovations meant there was no Jacuzzi, or Rooftop bar.

The Scarlet Singapore,Great Staff - Shame About The Hotel..,"Scarlet by name, and scarlet by nature; entering the foyer a couple of weeks before Christmas was like Santa’s Grotto on acid - they couldn’t have crammed more ‘red’ in there if they’d tried, making sunglasses almost obligatory… Much has already been said about the hotel’s general condition - particularly carpets - and it’s all true; red does not take kindly to wear and tear. It’s also weird to stay in a room without a window but the air on was on top form, working quietly and methodically throughout, so fresh air was not missed. Also previous reviews have covered the hotel’s location, which is great if walking is your thing; Maxwell over the road, Ann Siang up (and down) the hill, and Chinatown on the doorstep - even Lau Pa Sat is doable at 800m.

Was booked into one of their themed suites and it was truly a memorable experience.

There are attached balconies for some of the suite rooms, and I was thankful to be assigned one with. To top it off, the room comes with a fully stock bar with drinks and wines. These are replenished everyday and the spacious living area makes it suitable for a cosy gathering for any occasion.

I can honestly say the team here are the kindest and most helpful of any hotel I have ever stayed at. This is an old building so it doesn't have soundproofed windows. I'm a light sleeper and was concerned about being able to sleep at the front of the building, facing the road, so had asked if it was possible to move to a quieter room. Diana on reception went above and beyond to make sure I was happy with the room I ended up in. And she was so lovely about it. Ordinarily, I think I would have felt like I was being a pain, but it just felt that they wanted me to have the best experience I could.

The Scarlet Singapore,"Good location, not clean at all",I was supposed to stay here for 14 nights for a business trip. I left after 5 (I couldnt cancel these 5 nights). Pros: - location is great - I stayed in the premium king and the room was big Cons: - It wasn't cleaned! I had hairs both in the sink and in the towel. - Costumer service: when I told this to the front desk they only came to clean the next day and didn't think this was a big deal. - the bed was bumpy which means that your knees are really high which caused a back pain. - noisy! You hear everything- outside parties and next door rooms. I wouldn't stay here again.,2 out of 5,September 2022,4.0 of 5 stars,#17 of 372 hotels in Singapore,0.1206060606060606,0.29454545454545455,56.03030303030303,29.454545454545457,12.06060606060606,Services

The Scarlet Singapore,Really great location if a little quirky,"We were a family of 5 so needed 3 separate rooms but it still worked out cheaper than almost all other central hotels in Singapore. Style/Decor - our teenage kinds loved the rather sultry decor with red corridors and suggestive messaging. Also had a great, popular rooftop bar. Location - positioned in a lovely redeveloped arcade of shops, perfect for exploring Chinatown and adjoining central areas. We were able to access hundreds of bars and restaurants within a few minutes. Only downside was some night time noise from nearby bars. Service - very friendly and efficient reception service. Rooms - quite small and a bit tired. Big difference in size of bathrooms so suggest a request for larger one.

The Scarlet Singapore,Character & Charm,"I stayed at this property for the first time in over 5 years and was kind of shocked to find that very little had changed in that time. Firstly the positives, it oozes charm, character and is kind of funky. Location is great for the various restaurants and bars that are everywhere. If you want something different from the typical corporate style hotel that caters for business travellers, The Scarlet makes a nice change. However, its now getting quite tired, which is why I was surprised there didnt appear to be any type of recent upgrade or renovation. I stayed in one of the suites, and at over $500/night including taxes, there's just no way Id be able to justify that again.

The balcony room was a nice size and I enjoyed sitting on the balcony watching the world go by. The bed was hard as a rock though and I struggled to sleep most nights for the 9 nights I was there. In stark contrast the pillows were super soft and my head went right through them to the bed. I called for more pillows and was only allowed 2 more (my wife also wanted 2 more for the same reason and was denied). The location is excellent. It's a stone's throw from the Maxwell Hawker and the Maxwell MRT (when it opens very soon) and a short walk to the heart of Chinatown.

The hotel is perfect for couple who need to be away and with the complimentary mini bar makes one not want to leave the room. Mini bar is fully stocked. Couple of choices..not just ure typical mineral water . They even provide a few snacks too! The cheapest room has no window but just a small skylight so room can be very claustrophobic for some. Also the bed can be hard for some and pillows are super soft. Not ideal for people like me. No bathtub but water pressure is good",4 out of 5,October 2021,4.0 of 5 stars,#17 of 372 hotels in Singapore,0.00714285714285711,0.5345238095238096,50.357142857142854,53.45238095238096,0.714285714285711,Services

The Scarlet Singapore,Great hospitality!,"My cousin and I did a two-night staycation over the weekend at The Scarlet. Since it was not my first time staying there, I must admit that the rooms weren't as spectacular as they once were when I stayed there a good 15 years ago (which is to be expected). That said, the front desk staff, Faizal and Machelle, more than made up for this. They were friendly and attentive and did whatever they could to make our stay enjoyable, from ensuring that our faulty internet connection was promptly fixed to always greeting us with warm smiles and some conversation - plus a readiness to spring into action should we need anything - each time we passed them coming in or going out.

The Scarlet Singapore,Not Good Enough,"Whoever had the idea of converting this former street of derelict Chinatown ‘shophouses’ into a hotel did a great job. You can feel some of the history of the area in this property and it has close proximity to the centre of Chinatown and the excellent Chinatown Heritage Museum. We asked for a room upgrade at this hotel because we had been warned that some rooms don’t have windows. However the ‘Executive’ room that we ended up in was extremely cramped and the décor looked tired.

The Scarlet Singapore,A homelike BOUTIQUE experience in Central Singapore,"I was in Singapore for a night and wanted to book a hotel experience instead of just a 'normal' hotel. I booked The Scarlet and when I checked in Rozie from the front desk team was extremely friendly and welcoming and even upgraded my booking from the standard room to The Passion Suite (the hotel's best room), I even got my own Jacuzzi on the balcony where I sipped a glass of wine under the moonlight. It was such a great room, very boudoir sexy, and I loved my night there. Super friendly staff and I even had a long conversation with the front desk staff the morning I left. Highly recommend booking in with The Scarlet if you are looking for an 'out of the ordinary' experience in Singapore.

The Scarlet Singapore,Could be better,"We used to frequent Casa Tartufo (within the hotel premises) when we lived in Singapore and I was intrigued by the hotel. Now as a visitor, I thought I would try The Scarlet for a change instead of going for the usual big hotel names, particularly as I like its location. We stayed 2x within a span of a week as we went for a short trip in between. I booked the Executive Room for both bookings except the 2nd stay had the balcony. The rooms are small but I expected that. What I didn’t expect was how the room with the balcony is actually much smaller inside. It costs more but it’s not worth it unless you really plan to spend a lot of time on the balcony where the view is not even nice. With the balcony, they’ve compromised on the room space. The room designs are okay although it",3 out of 5,September 2019,4.0 of 5 stars,#17 of 372 hotels in Singapore,0.09404761904761905,0.34880952380952385,54.702380952380956,34.88095238095239,9.404761904761905,Location
The Scarlet Singapore,Atmospheric hotel right next to Chinatown.,"The hotel is in a row of converted shop houses and could not be in a better position, just a couple of minutes walk into Chinatown where you can get the underground or buses. It is also an easy walk to many of the main attractions including Clarke Quay, Raffles and Marina Bay. The public areas of the hotel are first class and a little unusual however the room was one of the smallest I have ever stayed in. Having said that it was well equipped with just about everything you would want for a short business or leisure stay. Breakfast was a very limited choice but was freshly prepared and very enjoyable. On the last day of our stay it was great to be able to go back to the hotel after a hot day exploring the city to have a hot shower before going off to the airport.",4 out of 5,September 2019,4.0 of 5 stars,#17 of 372 hotels in Singapore,0.25109126984126984,0.49855820105820103,62.554563492063494,49.8558201058201,25.109126984126984,Location

The Scarlet Singapore,Lovely boutique hotel in great location,"Stayed at The Scarlet for four nights, a very well appointed most unusual boutique hotel, positioned close to Chinatown and many bars and restaurants. Marina Bay was a short MRT subway ride away or a steady 25 minute walk if you fancy it. We had an executive room with a balcony which was small but enough for the amount of time we spent in it. The room was beautifully furnished and kept spotlessly clean by our maid. Front desk could not have been more helpful and friendly, a special mention for Nigel who went beyond the call to help us when needed.

We generally look for smaller boutique hotels but this one let us down compared to others we’ve stayed in in Asia The outside still has the old fashioned look but inside was dark with teeny tiny rooms. Nice colours & all, just small & claustrophobic. We did have a teeny balcony but fit only one person at a time. The lobby & all the staff we encountered were very nice & the position is very handy to Maxwell Hawker Centre & Chinatown. The best thing we found though was a little bar (just up to the corner & left down to a blue building) on the roof & behind Scarlet. It was so cute with the best cocktails made with flavoured teas.

The Scarlet Singapore,Somewhat over-sold,"The airport taxi driver had no idea where it was, but I did – in Erskine Road, just off South Bridge Road, in Chinatown. The entrance suggests either a casino or an up-market escorted karaoke bar – gold, black sparkling granite, crimson. The street level front of the hotel comprises the original (more or less) shophouses, which means that the ground-floor rooms lack any daylight (there is a tiny skylight, perhaps to satisfy some technical regulation, but it admits neither light nor sky). This is useful if, as I was, you are keen to readjust your body clock to some other time-zone. Otherwise it is a bit oppressive.

It is surrounded by great bars, restaurants and easy walking to many attractions - Maxwell hawker centre, Chinatown, Marina bay, shopping malls and more. Unfortunately the hotel was a let down in a few areas. 1. Room size, we were upgraded which was lovely. Unfortunately the executive room we were given was tiny. Too small for two people. As we were traveling for three weeks we had two cases and carry bags. There was just no room to store things. I completely get that the hotel is converted from shops and the size comes from this. With that in mind I would recommend to single travellers. 2. Avoid breakfast. We had it included in our booking. There is not a good selection.

It’s about 20/25 minute (easy) walk to the Marina Bay and there is an MRT station less than 5 mins away (Chinatown). There is a small gym which we used a couple of times.

The Scarlet Singapore,Great value for the location,"The Scarlet is the perfect place to stay for a night or two while you are exploring Singapore. The value for the quality of the room as well as the location is hard to beat. I'd definitely suggest getting a room other than the basic so you have some natural light coming into your room through either a skylight and/or window. The hotel is well equipped with a rooftop bar, gym access and really everything you need in a hotel room. The location is close to multiple hawker centres and is a quick walk to the Chinatown Metro Station which can really get you anywhere in the city pretty quickly. The staff is helpful and will help make your stay as comfortable as they can.

The Scarlet Singapore,Sadly not quite what it used to be,"I used to stay at the Scarlet back in 2005 and it was a glorious experience, staff were all very well trained and obviously proud of the place, the bedding and design were over-specced for the price, it was just a wonderful, bold experience for guests. Right now it feels a bit lost, there has clearly been refurbishment and yet there seems to have been slightly less attention to design and detail and even in the way the windows have been haphazardly nailed shut in the room I stayed in...not quite the same Scarlet as I loved in my previous visits.

The Scarlet Singapore,Pros and cons,"I came to this 4* hotel with my wife and stayed 6 nights in room #308. I would like to start with the cons: Firstly, this has been the smallest room I’ve ever been. And the smallest means less than 12 m2. It was really challenging to move around the room without hitting your knee with any corner of the bed or the furniture. If the room were twice as big, it would be perfect. Also the price... a little bit out of range. Think about this: by the price that you are 6 nights here (breakfast included), you could afford 3 or 4 nights in the luxurious Marina Bay Hotel. Now the pros: This boutique-style hotel is very nicely decorated with carpets and coaches with very vivid colors in the lobby. The location is also a strong point of the hotel.

Places where the grout had been repaired - badly, mould on the ceiling and a strip of wallpaper to patch up a hole on the wall that was done very badly. Other thing that bothered me which is more architectural was the sky light. There's no way to block out the light and if you are wanting to have a bit of a sleep in, the sky light doesn't help.

The Scarlet Singapore,Simply excellent,"We stayed at The Scarlet a couple of weeks ago, and found it to be just wonderful. Our room, an Executive with balcony was certainly smallish, but hey have you been to Paris or Venice? And we had a balcony, for we would never go anywhere in the tropics without one: you do need to be outside. The location is excellent, away from the hustle of uptown Singapore, a few steps from the hawker market and the delights of Ann Siang Road. We walked miles from one end of Singapore to the other, knowing that we could come back to our great room in such a great location.

The Scarlet Singapore,"Interesting hotel, worth a stay.","On a recent stopover in Singapore we chose The Scarlet for somewhere different. We're glad we chose this place. Reservation online was easy as the website is good. The hotel has street appeal as it is a converted row of tenement houses. Because of the nature of these houses the rooms are small although the hotel gives a clear description of this on their website. So not much more than a bed, wardrobe and a small desk. The bathroom however is more than adequate. One of the features of the hotel is the scarlet theme and this is very tastefully done with interesting furnishings and decor. One highlight of the hotel though is the staff. Service could not be faulted. Breakfast in the restaurant was also very good.
