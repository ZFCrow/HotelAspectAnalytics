For amenities, more customer-oriented services should be provided, such as high-speed internet, meals, and other services that customers expect from a top-notch experience. For location, more areas should be considered for potential tourist attractions and spots that would draw more attention. For services, customer service should be improved with more qualified professionals and measures to enhance the overall customer satisfaction. Finally, for general, an effort should be made to create a positive image of the business to the public by engaging in public-facing marketing activities, as well as improving the customer experience through better services and amenities."
