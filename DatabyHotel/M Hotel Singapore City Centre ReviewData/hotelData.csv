M Hotel Singapore City Centre,We won't be back,"We are seasoned travellers to Singapore and on this occasion chose to stay at M-Hotel because the room (Family Suite) could accommodate our teenage daughter with us. Most other hotels required a booking of 2 rooms which we considered as unsuitable; or charging for 3 adults in a twin room which was the equivalent price to 2 rooms. If you are a business traveller, this hotel would be suitable. It is functional. If you are a tourist, then look elsewhere. In the vicinity of this Hotel there isn't much for the tourist. Local restaurants and cafes cater to the daytime crowd and thus the area is dead at night with limited cheerful dining and entertainment options.

M Hotel Singapore City Centre,Covers all bases.,"The problem in Singapore is always the expense over the reality, and hotels are a prime example of this.

Luckily the M Hotel is a good combination of a sizable room, nice views, quiet floors, and a great location for getting around town.

M Hotel Singapore City Centre,Avoid,Singapore is a city for the best hotels with the best and most efficient service at reasonable rates. If you are willing to spend a lot for a good hotel u may like to avoid this one because it only charges premium for its location. Food is very average and rather limited variety for the price. The staff is quite insensitive and just goes about doing thier thing hospitality is completely lacking here. Being Indian we were looking foward to some good Indian food on the contrary we got offered biryani rice for breakfast. for the amount this hotel charges they should be giving fabulous service. F&B service and quality are just far below the standards this hotel should have.

M Hotel Singapore City Centre,EXTREMELY disappointed,"EXTREMELY disappointed with this hotel! There is NO possible way it is a 4 or 4.5 star hotel. NO way. Let‚Äôs start at check in...I booked a premier twin room because we are a family of 4 (2 adults and 2 kids) coming here on vacation. When we arrived the man checking us in was very confused that we had 4 people going into one room, even though the reservation clearly stated it. He told us the premier twin room wouldn‚Äôt accommodate 4 people! We ended up getting a room with a king bed for 3 people and a roll in bed for one. NOT ideal!!! To the mans credit he was very nice and helpful (the only reason this got 2 stars and not 1). The next issue is the pool. It looks nothing like the pictures.

My boyfriend pulled up his confirmation to in fact show that we had reserved the room for 4.

M Hotel Singapore City Centre,Delicious Hot Pot in town,"Visited the steamboat restaurant located at Level 2 of M hotel recently with my family for birthday celebration. Nice soups , fresh ingredients and good variety of food options from seafood to meat and vegetables. We love their durian pur√©e and it was so nice that we had at least 3 servings each . Service really makes you feel comfortable and little touches like helping you to control the temperature for your steamboat, offering you a nut cracker upon seeing you having crabs and the consistency of topping up your soup and quenchers were a real pleasant surprises . We were presented with a slice cake decorated nicely upon ending our meal .

We were recommended by our friends to try this steamboat restaurant as we are all fan of buffets . We were greeted warmly at the entrance by the staff who then lead us to a cosy nice corner of the restaurant . She patiently and professionally explained the type of soup available and also suggested us their popular Double Boiled Pork Bone Collagen Soup from Japan which turns out to be our best ever steamboat buffet dinner that evening . Throughout the dinner the staffs and the manageress too were very attentive to our needs and they served other tables equally well too .

M Hotel Singapore City Centre,A good stay overall,"We got upgraded from a Deluxe to a Club room which was great. However, we found the bed to be really small. The bathtub was also smaller in comparison to the standard ones we are used to in hotels. The bathroom could have been a little more spacious. Everything was a tad too compact. Besides these minor issues, the room was really nice and spacious. Service was just lukewarm with the exception of one staff who greeted us at breakfast on both days. He was the only one who was welcoming and nice. Breakfast options could have been varied.

It is not located near anything and the train station is good 10 minutes walk away. Room was good though it had a comfy bed, tv, safe, iron etc however the bathroom wasn't up to scratch it felt very old and dated compared to the rest of the hotel room and it was very small.

Also just as you enter the room, you will find 2 water bottles and think it might be the complementary water but be careful it's not, It cost me S$ 16 as it was ""Evian"" water from the french alps. Not worth paying such an amount for just 2 water bottles and best thing is it's a twin pack and if you open one bottle, you will be charged for 2.

M Hotel Singapore City Centre,Good value for money in Singapore,"Stayed at M hotel for two nights and was pleased with the quality of the hotel.

There is a nice restaurant and cafe in the building. The rooms are larger than the Singapore norm and the bathrooms are a little small.

M Hotel Singapore City Centre,Excellent Hotel,I was at M hotel with 2 others attending Singapore Round Table 3 Charter event. The hotel was booked by our collegues in S'pore and it was way better than expected. Though its not my usual area of stay I found it to be very convenient and not in the heart of the city but close enough for everything. It's got many businesses around and few resturants at the back road and close to cleark quay and street food areas. The staff was very accomodative and helpful. Specially the front desk. I would stay again in this hotel gladly.,5 out of 5,October 2017,4.0 of 5 stars,#25 of 372 hotels in Singapore,0.1255952380952381,0.40178571428571425,56.279761904761905,40.17857142857142,12.55952380952381,Services

M Hotel Singapore City Centre,nicely located business hotel offering pleasant stay,"Stayed 4 nights at M hotel. It was the delux room and was quite enough as I was outside, most of the day time. The house keeping was perfect and they refilled everything promptly. The Gym and the swimming pool are not the best but ample for a business hotel like this. The breakfast was included in the booking and it was really good. I used the dine-in room service couple of times for some snacks and the quality was perfect. I felt the pricing for food is on a higher side. You can find 7/11 super market as well as a McDonalds near by the hotel. In around 300m you can find more restaurants as well. There is a bus stop just opposite to the hotel and a MRT station within five minutes walk. So accessibility to other parts of the country is easy.

The public areas are perfectly pleasant and, though I didn't actually eat at the hotel's restaurant, when I walked through the food looked extremely good (and the diners looked very pleased with themselves).

M Hotel Singapore City Centre,Nice hotel.,This hotel is located in the financial center of Singapore. I think all the rooms have breakfast included which is a nice addition otherwise they charge $30 for breakfast. If you need to use the local Metro the subway station closest by it's about a 5 to 10 minute walk. Chinatown is about 25 or 30 minute walk if you're interested to see that and most else in the downtown probably requires a transit or ride of some kind to get there. The hotel is comfortable. The rooms a bit small and you can hear your neighbours through the walls somewhat.  Nice showers. Beds were firm but comfy. Single beds. Loved the complimentary cell phone they give you to take around in Singapore. Internet everywhere you go and calls.
