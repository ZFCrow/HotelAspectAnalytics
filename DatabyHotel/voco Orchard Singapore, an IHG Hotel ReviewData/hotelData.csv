"voco Orchard Singapore, an IHG Hotel",Club convenience,We booked a Club room for about a week here and it was really enjoyable. The breakfast spread was phenomenal. The Club package came with afternoon tea and canape hour and I have to say it was well worth it. Free flow of drinks and quite a nice spread for canape hour. I think most days we didnt end up eating dinner because we had eaten so much. If I were to be critical of one thing the pool is quite dated and not very child friendly. Tiles were peeling off and the pool goes from kids section to deep very quickly. The service was really good though.. Our flight was delayed so we arrived around 2am and they greeted us by name when we walked into the hotel. Must have been the last guests to check in but shows that staff are paying attention which mirrored the rest of our stay,5 out of 5,February 2018,5.0 of 5 stars,#34 of 372 hotels in Singapore,0.31488095238095243,0.5011904761904763,65.74404761904762,50.11904761904763,31.488095238095244,Amenities

The executive room was a typical Hilton room. Modern design, comfy bed and good amenities. What was missing was a USB port at the bedside. Bathroom was quite small. What bothered me was the smell of mustiness in the room and and the whole 20th floor. I think it is because of the age of the building, the carpets and the general humidity.

"voco Orchard Singapore, an IHG Hotel",Still good,"I hadn't stayed for many years and used the Conrad mainly. The building hasn't changed, although some upgrade work obviously has been done. The rooms on the Exec Floor level are a bit too small still(that can only be changed by major reconstruction), but the combination of location and the service provided still does the job for the Hilton. The Hotel should consider a further change of the Exec Lounge. It has been expanded and the food and drinks on offer expanded a bit, but it is still way too small. That leads to an almost permanent overcrowding in particular for evening drinks and then it is way too loud and not always enjoyable, as some guests can't resist moving business meeting and/or calls to the Lounge.

"voco Orchard Singapore, an IHG Hotel",I fall in love with the bathroom,My recent stay with a few hotels doesn’t deliver great experience with the bathroom. Here at Hilton Singapore I found no flaws in the bathroom especially about the water. The shower delivers good form of water with no leakage in anyway. All taps deliver good flow of water. The bath tub can be filled quickly. It can drain water quickly as well. The shower curtain can hold the water without letting even one drop of water flows out of the bath tub. The water temperature control is amazing. You can add just the water temperature up to 50°C (or may be higher). This provides you the Japanese onsen experience in the hotel. I think the water control sign on the taps are clear enough for the guest to not confused on adjusting the water temperature but the hotel pay even more attention on,4 out of 5,May 2019,5.0 of 5 stars,#34 of 372 hotels in Singapore,0.2947916666666667,0.5427083333333333,64.73958333333334,54.270833333333336,29.479166666666668,Cleaniness

Had to lunge my 2 luggage on my own up the stairs (minor inconvenience, could improve perhaps). However, the front desk manager was warm and friendly, kudos to her. It's a bit of a disappointment though that somehow they would not upgrade me to a suite despite me being a Hilton Diamond member and there were suites available - the reason being some of their suites were undergoing a renovation. Requested for payment to confirm suite upgrade instead! How disappointing. Given premium room - despite it being refurbished I found some areas of the room still quite dated.

"voco Orchard Singapore, an IHG Hotel",An aged hotel but still fine,"This was our second stay at the Hilton Singapore. As Diamond members we see quite a few properties in the Hilton stable and as far as this one goes, it is a reasonably solid offering, albeit that it is an aged property (built 1969, opened 1970) and although renovated (in part), the reality is that the age does show in parts. Think peeling wallpaper, knocked wood surrounds and just an absence of many things you just see in newer hotels like USB ports etc. My upgraded room was nice and somewhat renovated but you could still tell you were in a very old bathroom that had been subject to some makeover.

But otherwise, it's a nice room. Breakfast is not included in the basic rate which I find incredibly irritating. Lower end hotels include breakfasts. Granted, this is a fancier breakfast but still.

The staff are fantastic, nothing is too much trouble and so friendly they felt like family. However, the jewel in the crown are the executive rooms. Singapore is not a cheap place to eat and drink, but if you pay the extra you get access to the executive lounge which has its own check in desk. It is open all day for tea and coffee.

But they all tried to give the same level of hospitality and assistance. I also want to acknowledge the lady front desk when I checked in. Her name is Hannah. I asked if I there’s a birthday upgrade and she politely told me she would check and she accommodated me. I appreciate the gesture. Even the staff who assisted me at the lift. The breakfast is now served as set but it’s okay still filling and I can say the hotel did try to uphold the clean and safety protocol overall. I never felt afraid to spend my staycation outside our home and glad I chose Hilton.

"voco Orchard Singapore, an IHG Hotel",Disappointment,"Stayed at Hilton for one night in January for a staycation. It's a old hotel but rooms are still in a good and well maintained condition. For the price that I paid and the location that it's in, I didn't have any complaints. But what upset and disappoint me was that I bought drinks back to the room and the fridge in the room wasn't cold so I asked for a bucket of ice. The reply I got was that I have to order in room dining and only then they will get the bucket of ice to be send together. If not I have to go down to their bar and get my own bucket of ice from the bar. I've stayed at many 5 star hotels in Singapore and this is the first time that I've heard of this.

This is a old hotel that I think was furbished, overall the hotel is clean and neat. The deluxe room was also a decent size, with a desk and an extra sofa and coffee desk for dining. The room is ok, but what i appreciate is that there is alot of electrical plug of different volts to cater to the different countries. If you're here for staycay, be prepared to park at opp hotel 4Seasons where there is complimentary parking too. Coz at Hilton, there is one 1 floor to park and the wait is too long.

For the Orchard area, this will be a somewhat more affordable option as it is not in a very ""prime"" location within the Orchard area. It is still a reasonable walking distance away if you are a walker. Everything was average from room size, housekeeping, and value for money. The only thing to note is there is a designated smoking space outside the hotel that you will need to walk past on your way to Orchard. I found this annoying and this is probably the one reason I will prefer not to come back for a return stay.

From arrival to departure nothing was too much trouble for the staff and that to me is the epitome of a classy establishment. Check in was both quick and efficient and thanks for allowing us an earlier than expected check in. Rooms are spacious, quiet and spotlessly clean. Breakfast has everything that you would need or think of and the way the tables are laid out it is relaxing enough to be able to take your time and just enjoy. The bar area in the evening is really laid back although I would question it closing a tad too early.

"voco Orchard Singapore, an IHG Hotel",There's lots of good service in Singapore - but this hotel adds the personal touch,"I can chose to stay wherever I want on my regular business and leisure visits to Singapore. I chose to stay at Voco for the genuine friendliness of the staff and the quality and value of the rooms. The hotel GM Mark leads by example by valuing guests with attention to detail. The Club Lounge on level 22 managed by Kenny is a haven of great breakfasts, afternoon tea and evening canopies and friendly attentive staff who have the balance right in delivering a personal service that is never intrusive. If you want a superb steak the Opus is the place to go- they know their meat and also how to cook and serve it. Book one of the Suiyes and you et a steam room in the bathroom- its awesome and very effective . The location on Orchard road is perfect for business, shopping and touring",5 out of 5,September 2023,5.0 of 5 stars,#34 of 372 hotels in Singapore,0.5491558441558442,0.6875124875124875,77.45779220779221,68.75124875124875,54.91558441558442,Amenities
