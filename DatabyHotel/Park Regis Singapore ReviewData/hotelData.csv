Park Regis Singapore,Average - Does What It Says On The Tin.,"Stayed here for 4 nights in October, in their standard double room. Hotel is in a good location, being only 10 mins walk to the bars and restaurants along the river. Room was a typical city/business style, - clean and adequate. Accommodation in Singapore isn’t cheap, - and for the price I paid, - you would get a lot more elsewhere in Asia, - put the price seems average/fair for the area. Breakfast was nothing to write home about, - though I’d prefer if the coffee was a stronger Italian style, rather that the insipid American sort. Staff were courteous and professional. Overall, my stay was fine. The only annoyances were being woken in the morning as a lady was shouting down the corridor asking if any room wanted their laundry done !! Also, although the hotel has a pool",3 out of 5,December 2018,4.0 of 5 stars,#104 of 372 hotels in Singapore,0.17687908496732027,0.42483660130718953,58.84395424836602,42.48366013071895,17.687908496732028,Value

Park Regis Singapore,8 of the most amazing days at Park Regis Singapore,"It is hard to know where to start. The Park Regis has a wonderful location close to Clarke Quay, the CBD and China Town. It was the perfect base for our holidays. The room was magical yes some people could say small but the space is so cleverly used, the bed the most comfortable ever, by the first morning I would normally have a sore back, but after eight nights, no issue. The pool is fantastic and amazing ambiance for an inter city location. Finally the staff, every single one of them and it does matter where they worked within the hotel, were just the best.

Park Regis Singapore,Not Up To Standard,"Arrived 1:30am after a late night flight, and were looking forward to a snack before turning in. Was a little shocked to told there was no room service, and was directed to a nearby 7 Eleven. Was further disappointed to find we could not get a continental breakfast in the dining room, only a full buffet breakfast for $27. The pool was a pleasant spot and a nice retreat but you cannot get a snack or drink there which ruins the holiday experience. We found the room on the small size, and it was unusual to have the vanity in the bedroom, and shower and toilet in adjoining glass cubicles. Judging from the mould present inside and outside the shower, as well as rotting carpet, ventilation is a major problem with this type of layout.

Park Regis Singapore,Pretty standard accommodation in a decent location,"Stayed at the Park Regis during the Grand Prix weekend. Chose the hotel based on the walking distance to the track (along the riverside) and the pricing given the high demand during the race weekend. The first Park Queen Room we were offered was quite grim; there wasn't much of an outlook or natural light, and the decor was very dated. Due to the length of stay, we requested an alternative room which appeared slightly updated and was overlooking the adjoining mosque which was preferable. The standard room is fairly generic with a queen bed, flat TV etc but the bay window is a nice touch. The layout with the ""open bathroom"" is a little annoying for a couple in terms of privacy etc, but its workable. We did not have the daily breakfast or eat in the ground floor restaurant.

Park Regis Singapore,"""Open concept"" room, no privacy!","The hotel is in a great location in the center of Singapore. The hotel staff are extremely friendly. But I was forced to search for another room. Specifically, the hotel claims that their rooms are built in an ""open concept"" style. The toilet, shower and bed are all in the same space. The toilet door only partially and visually separates the space between the bed and the toilet! I could not accept a room where I sleep only a meter away from the toilet, which does not have the ability to completely close the door. At my insistence, I was given another room, this staff was very willing to respond to my request.

Park Regis Singapore,New Year Visit,"When we arrived the concierge staff were really lovely. We arrived early and was told the room wasn’t ready but we could leave our bags and come back.

Just after 3pm we was allowed to check in. The staff again were really nice. Our room was nice and simple. The layout of the bathroom wasn’t the best and we had little tiny bugs around the sink and taps. The bed was really comfy however when I woke up in the morning I couldn’t stop itching and had little bite marks all over me, this happened a lot more on the last night and when checking out I told a member of staff and they apologised.

Park Regis Singapore,Amazing hotel with the best staff ever!,"We initially only planned to stay 4 nights at the Park Regis hotel. However, due to changes to our travel plans we ended up staying for 10 nights and I am glad we chose this hotel. It was a great location in Singapore and good value for money being only a stones throw away from the busy tourist spot Clarke quay for Bars and Restaurants. As it was our first time in Singapore we were offered complimentary breakfast for each day of our stay which came in handy as food can be expensive in Singapore and the breakfast buffet selection was really good, they changed the menu every few days which was a positive as well.

Park Regis Singapore,Quarantine Stay - Solo,Got summoned by government to serve 11days quarantine over here at Park Regis Singapore. Gotta say I am impressed by the hotel management. Meal served are delicious and there are various type of cuisine that fit everyone personal preference. During the stay the hotel management even hold a virtual zoom meeting to bring joy and fun to all the people who came here for quarantine stay. It is the first hotel which communicate with you on Whatsapp aside from the room telephone which made the communication great as the response on Whatsapp is very fast. Wifi connection is smooth as well and i guess it did a good job for all of my virtual e-meeting during my stay. Gotta say one day I would revisit here again as staycation mode when everything settled down.

Park Regis Singapore,Affordable and good quality hotel in a central location,"I would rate it 10 is the restaurant is open and we don't have to eat inside the room as it is not equipped with chairs and tables that can accommodate two persons.

On the customer service side the staff are very helpful with accommodating requests even if the hotel is undermanned. I am also grateful for the cupcake and card given for my birthday. I didn't get to try other amenities, only the pool that while it is not too large there are only a few people using it so I had a good time swimming by myself. Too bad there is no mini-bars to serve drinks on request.

Park Regis Singapore,General review,"I stayed here a lot before COVID and happy to see that after 2.5 years away from Singapore, the hotel has added extra self serve laundry service at the basement. it's a huge benefit for me as I travel a lot and laundry is one of the factors to consider when I choose a hotel. In general, the hotel is good, clean and bright. The housekeeping crew is very accommodating with my small requests. The only problem I have with this hotel is the smell of drainage in the shower room and toilet, the smell was not as strong during my stay last week, however, it's quite strong when I returned to stay at the hotel (in a different room) this time. Breakfast choices are improved this week but not a lot of healthy options for cereals.

Very very small room, shower & toilet are in glass cubes on the side of the bed. Honestly the worst. The overall cleanliness was very poor.

Only 1 person on reception. Took 20 minutes wait to check out 2 rooms then half an hour to process our check in. Staff was surly and arrogant. Room was dirty, beds messy, badly designed and tiny to boot. Standard single size bed only. Room was not dark as wardrobe light never went off. Air conditioner was complicated.

Reception staff on the other hand were very cold, unhelpful and seemed to be displeased to be disturbed from their computers for check in/check out! The rooms are well equipped and bed comfortable. It is an open plan bathroom/bedroom which might not be ideal for some, but fine as a solo traveller. The air con is very weak and could do with being upgraded.

I am less than impressed with modern hotel room layouts like this, where the wash basin is in the main room space and it has separate cubicles for toilet and shower. Moving from toilet into main room then to shower then back to main room to dry is not a smooth nor pleasing experience.

Park Regis Singapore,Great Location,"First time to stay in this hotel and in my opinion, its best asset would be its location as well as Angel from the Reception Desk as well as Sophia (breakfast omelette staion) and most of the breakfast crew in the restaurant. Angel was very welcoming and took an extra step to make sure that my room requirements would be looked after; a very welcome reception upon arrival and warm farewell upon departure. Sophia would ensure that everyones omelettes were done to their liking despite being very busy on certain days.

Park Regis Singapore,Park Regis and Singapore almost have it back to the good old days.,"After some negative comments from family and friends it was great to get back to a fully functioning Singapore. Still a few minor problems re smoking in public however this brief trip was great. The Park Regis was also the ideal stop over hotel for a few days. Breakfast wasn't anywhere near as good as it used to be; lovely omelette chef but the rest of the experience was pretty poor for the money and not what you'd expect from a hotel of this calibre. Room service should be 24 hours for a transit City but stopped at 9.30 pm so ended up in a wacky Korean BBQ restaurant, jet lagged at 11.00 pm suffering an onslaught of ethnic discordant pop music:( Big shout out for Pettrina and William on reception at the Park Regis who were brilliant and looked after so well when arriving after",5 out of 5,April 2023,4.0 of 5 stars,#104 of 372 hotels in Singapore,0.18684210526315792,0.5342105263157894,59.3421052631579,53.42105263157894,18.68421052631579,Services

I know Singapore is expensive but it was a bit like nickeling and diming which left an impression for me.

Park Regis Singapore,Hotel is very tired and really needs an upgrade.,"We only stayed here for three nights to break up the long journey home from Australia, and chose the hotel due to location and the fact that they had rooms that had direct access to the pool.

There is no separate bathroom as such, just a small wall with a weird gap that separated the bed area from the shower cubicle and toilet, both of which had somewhat transparent frosted doors which offered only minimal privacy. The decor is very old and tired, with obvious dents in the walls and scuff marks in many places. We only had two bath towels and two flannels on arrival, (no hand towels).

The hotel is within walking distance of lots of shops, malls, and restaurants. It is literally right across the street from a bridge that leads to Clarke Quay and its collection of restaurants.

The staff is super friendly and the place was very clean. Bonus content: download and setup the Grab app (their equivalent to Lyft and Uber) before you visit Singapore - it is the cheapest and fastest way to get around.

The staff were extremely courteous and helpful and friendly, the food in the restaurant for dinner and breakfast was tasty and a good variety, the pool was a delight to swim in and relax beside.

It is close to Clarke Quay, a short walk to Chinatown and a good food court and also the MRT. The only negative was the design of the toilet in the room which didn’t have a solid floor to ceiling door so there was potential for smell to be in the small room when one used the toilet.
