"The Ritz-Carlton, Millenia Singapore",Exceeded our Expectations!!,"Our family of 4 had done quite a fair bit of staycations this past year in SG. However, Ritz totally wins us over with their exceptional services from arrival to departure. It was a birthday staycation for my two boys and we were upgraded to their 1 bedroom suite. Wow, the room was huge in size, two extra bed was added for the boys, birthday treats prepared in the room for them. Of course, not forgetting the “killer” view of the gorgeous marina bay areas! They certainly had a whale of time running around in the suite. Services at the club lounge was also wonderful, quiet and food was tasty too, especially love the breakfast.

I booked the 25th anniversary sale (1-for-1, for club marina room) and my experience from start to end was just mindblowing. The club staff were extremely responsive over email and very helpful, even pre-checkin. Ayaka from the front desk assisted us in checking in and she provided such wonderful service. The hotel had been thoughtful in upgrading us to a corner suite as they took note that it was for a birthday. I appreciated that throughout the stay, they continued to extend exemplary and thoughtful service despite us having purchased the room on sale. Ayaka even gave us a handwritten note and a box of (super yummy) chocolates which was a delight.

"The Ritz-Carlton, Millenia Singapore","An indistinct, underwhelming first-time experience","Let me start this review by highlighting how excited I was to have booked a 3D2N weekend couple stay (19-21 Mar) for a Deluxe Kallang room. This will put the following criticisms in a fairer context to the hotel. Why did I choose Ritz Carlton amongst all the luxury hotels in Singapore? I greatly appreciate elegant software so I can safely say it was first and foremost for the famed anticipatory guest service: “We are Ladies and Gentleman serving Ladies and Gentleman”- the motto suggested a refined warmth I admired. In short, my idea of what the gold standard of hotel guest service should be. Or so I assumed from the largely laudatory reviews on tripadvisor and lifestyle blogs I trawled through. So.

"The Ritz-Carlton, Millenia Singapore",Disappointing,"We had truly high hopes for this stay, but evidently the years have eroded the quality and class that once differentiated the Ritz. Rooms are dated and in dire need of a massive upgrade, not sure if that was more disappointing or the cheap strewn tea bags and leaking kettle. Service was extremely slow albeit friendly, even the infamous Colony was lacklustre in the face of a peak season. The Ritz is going to have to do a lot more to beat the new modern offerings out there, than simply rely on its namesake.

The positives - the front office staff were genuinely welcoming and friendly; the Marina Bay view from the room and bathroom was breathtaking, you would have to be incredibly jaded to fault it; we were here to celebrate my spouse’s birthday, and a complimentary birthday cake awaited us in the room upon check-in (nice touch, pretty standard for this category of hotels, but I mentioned this so that I may reference it again later). Then the negatives. Day 2, I personally informed the front desk for a 6 p.m. turndown service (indicated my preferences on a physical card which was placed in my room), but I returned at 8ish p.m. to realise it has not been done.

This is the best Ritz that I have stayed in (and I have used quite a number in the past) and possibly one of my favourite hotels I have ever used. I booked a club room and was given a room on the club lounge level (the top floor - level 32). On arrival I received a personal note form the manager and cakes and fruit in my room. The specification of the room was great and I could not find any faults with it. The condition was excellent. The daily housekeeping was great and the turndown service exceptional.

Republic had a new menu, which continues to spark my interests in their amazing selections of cocktails, and also never fails to impress me with their new additions.

"The Ritz-Carlton, Millenia Singapore",NYE Stay,"Our family stayed over NYE for our first visit to Singapore. Absolutely loved our rooms with views of Marina Bay. We opted for rooms with the club lounge access which turned out to be a great decision. In my opinion one of the better Ritz-Carlton club lounges out there and worth spending the extra money on. Jithra and the team took great care of us. We had some meals in Colony which is just exceptional, great service, great choices and a marvellous cheese selection to finish the meal off. Lee Lee gave us some nice treats that weren’t on display which was very much appreciated. The rooms are a great size but definitely showing their age and are in need of renovating but I’d say the staff make up for it easily.

"The Ritz-Carlton, Millenia Singapore",Wonderfully Comfortable Room and Outstanding Breakfast Selections,"We had a room at both the Marina Bay Sands and the Ritz Carlton since our family of four needed two rooms since MBS maximum was three guests (although easily could have fit a fourth, but that’s a different review). The Ritz was located right across a relatively short walkway from MBS and about a 10 minute easy walk from the Merlion. While the Ritz is not iconic from the outside like the MBS, I would say the lobby and more importantly, the room, was better than the MBS. The room was very, very large with beautiful wood floors and massive windows. But don’t fret…the windows had separate automated day and night shades. The bed was very comfortable which is really important if you’re working your way through jet lag.

"The Ritz-Carlton, Millenia Singapore",Super Staycation,"Stayed for two nights with the family to celebrate my wife’s birthday. Booked under Fine Hotels and could check in early and check out at 4pm. Unfortunately, the rooms were fully booked and no upgrade was available. However, check-in was smooth and the kids really liked the snacks at the reception. Ritz really know how to keep the kids happy - even when they have to wait. The really nice thing was to allow the kids to go around the hotel to get stamps and redeem an ice-cream at Colony. Everything at the hotel was really good - room was clean, daily housekeeping was done exceedingly well, breakfast was excellent, view of Marina Bay was mesmerising.

"The Ritz-Carlton, Millenia Singapore",Fake Ritz Carlton….very dated and stale 5 star hotel….shame on Singapore Tourism Authority to allow them to stay open!,1. Lobby smells like stale reused detergent in a public toilet. 2. Checkin took 45 minutes 3. We were not welcomed as part of Amex Fine Resorts and Hotels guests nor did anyone bother to introduce us to the Amex Platinum perks. We had to demand them. 4. We were lied to when we demanded the Amex platinum upgrade and they said we were already upgraded. I rechecked our bookings and we were not upgraded. 5. The bath towels have seen better days and years and scratched my body. 6. The Millenia Square skywalk has signs of all the hotels that connect to it except Ritz Carlton. 7. At breakfast we were given a table next to the kitchen till I made an issue about it having seen the tables 50% empty. 8. No butler service for this remarkable brand even for the suites. 9.

The room size was good and the breakfast at Colony was great.

Cons: - Rooms are aging. For example: - Wooden floor makes weird sounds all the time while walking on it. - Bathroom blinds came down and were unable to draw back up again. - Bathroom produces stinky smell over the night - The wait time for checkout is a bit too long when there are too many people waiting at the same time.

On the positive side the public areas (including the swimming pool) look great. Our expectation was the RC would be similar to the SMO or Fullerton in terms of quality, in reality it wasn't. Perhaps this was due to the hotel being very focused on conferences/events whilst we were there? Room was pretty dated although spotlessly clean. Club lounge was OK with good food offerings, service a little bit inconsistent.

My experience was nothing short of a nightmare, but what tipped the scales into the realm of the unforgivable was their laughable attempt at service recovery. Their solution? To pacify you with a complimentary stay, hoping you'll swallow your dissatisfaction and stop making a fuss. They'll go through the motions of CC'ing their upper management, but don't be fooled - none of them will lift a finger.

"The Ritz-Carlton, Millenia Singapore",Stunning views saved the day,"3rd time at Ritz Carlton Millenia, stayed one night at a Deluxe Kallang Room. Stunning views, super Instagramable. Very comfy bed but furniture starting to shows some age. There were patches of paint of the shower head, and the floor was uneven and ‘squeeky’ at some areas. Service by the reception and concierge were good, but what was disappointing and unacceptable was that nothing was done by the hotel although it was conveyed earlier that the stay was to celebrate a birthday. Sure it was not a given and some may say I am a cheap-skate nobody, but I expected more from a Ritz Carlton property. In fact, this is probably the first time I have stayed anywhere in the world to celebrate a special event, and no effort was made by the hotel to commemorate the occasion (we went Suntec",3 out of 5,March 2019,5.0 of 5 stars,#28 of 372 hotels in Singapore,0.20269841269841268,0.5106878306878307,60.13492063492063,51.06878306878308,20.26984126984127,Cleaniness

The rooms however are in bad need of an upgrade. For the price the quality is not there. Seems like they are “sweating the assets” as much as possible. The three nights I stayed I had to ask for them to come and clean the room as by 1600 hrs nobody had come!!! Their spa is nice but the air conditioning is so low that you freeze. Not really good for relaxing. Also they have the music on too load and despite various requests to lower it they did not. Perhaps they confused the spa for a disco!?

The location is the best - with a prime position to frame the famous Singapore Marina area - the Sands Casino on one edge of the sight line and the downtown skyline on the other side of the marina. Waking up to that beauty every morning is almost overwhelming - at night the lights on the iconic images are something to behold. Pro tip: Pay the extra money to have a marina view so you can witness this for yourself. It costs a bit more but is worth it. Also, the club level features (concierge, food and drinks) are also worth investing in if you are a routine breakfast eater or interested in a nightcap without leaving the property.

My only complaint is that the hotel did not tell us that there was a event at the hotel the evening we were there so we could not use the pool area, they would drive us to the Conrad hotel if we wanted to do that. We were only in Singapore one night and we couldn't use the facilities. The hotel was really busy with people coming and going for whatever corporate event they were having. It really bothers me when hotels do this. When I booked the hotel 2 months ago they had to have known this event was already scheduled. WHY DO HOTELS NOT TELL THEIR GUESTS WHEN THEY HAVE EVENTS???

"The Ritz-Carlton, Millenia Singapore",One of the better 5 stars in Singapore,Growing up in Singapore I’ve always wondered how the skyline of Raffles Place looked from those octagon windows. I was fortunate to experience that on my recent trip to Singapore. Singapore’s skyline has expanded since and the view from the rooms are drop dead gorgeous. Fit and finish is often lacking in 5 star properties in Singapore. This property doesn’t disappoint with its high quality furnishing that is modern enough for me and sufficiently restrain for my parents. The location is decent. Along the quieter part of the bay and within close distance of the shopping districts and business districts. Rarely stays are perfect. Ritz Carlton Singapore’s staff have a sharp eye in correcting errors they spot and initiating service recovery.

No comparison to any other Marriott brands (including the JW nearby).",5 out of 5,July 2019,5.0 of 5 stars,#28 of 372 hotels in Singapore,0.19285714285714287,0.3952380952380953,59.64285714285714,39.523809523809526,19.28571428571429,Amenities

The room rate was to be $500 per night. They kept $1008 of my dollars and would not return the money. I have fought with Expedia and the Hotel for 3 months.

Where to start? Well, as a local staycation treat for myself, I opted for a short stay over a long work weekend. From street level, the hotel's not really much to look at. Check in was a little slow on the day, mainly because other travellers were also checking in at the same time. But the process was professional and efficient, and I was soon on my way to the room. And what a room! My Deluxe Kallang twin room was more spacious than pretty much every hotel room I've been in (aside from perhaps my honeymoon suite).
