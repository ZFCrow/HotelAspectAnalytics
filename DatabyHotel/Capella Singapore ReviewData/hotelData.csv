Capella Singapore,Annual Birthday Stay for my friend,"Did a birthday celebration for my friend again in Capella, they really never fail to impress. There were little hiccups this round, but the service recovery we receive made the rest of our stay as exquisite as before by Mr Roman Angulo.

Capella Singapore,One of my favorite hotels In Singapore.,"My Singapore’s favorite hotel! First time returning to Capella after the four years’ Covid drama. This time I made a booking mistake, instead of June I picked “May”in my original booking. Of course my May booking became a “no-show” to the hotel. At first I thought it was the website error but I guessed it was my own mistake. Anyway when the front desk couldn’t find our booking when we arrived , they handled the situation professionally and comforted us in a calmly manner. With a cup of cool drink we were assured we would be taken care of. We were directed to the library to wait for the next available Villa. Everyone was so welcoming and friendly.

Capella Singapore,A class above the best,"Good luxury hotels in Singapore are plentiful, great ones even. But there is one that has continually captivated us (and our wallets) year after year – The Capella. It is not difficult to see why.

Rooms-wise, they are very likely the biggest at every category and also amongst the most beautifully designed. On a guest-size to property-size ratio, it is certainly feels like the biggest hotel in the country (just take a look at the amount of real estate the hotel occupies on Sentosa island, and you’ll get a sense of how privileged the guests and residents are).

Bathrooms are bright and well appointed with greenery view. This room has an extended outdoor area so you can walk around abit more which was great with my family. One thing is that I find the duvet way too thick and you really have to turn up the AC at night, and there is no choice of pillows as I find them too high.

Capella Singapore,Disappointing 'sea view' room,"Second-time stay at Capella with our dog. Booked a sea view king, but was very disappointed to discover that the room — located at the tail end of the building — was essentially overlooking Sentosa island itself. You get, at best, 30% of the promised sea view — the rest of your vista comprises of Sentosa island, including the RWS buildings in the distance. The balcony had no soft furnishings and only came with a hard stone 'bench' (which was not very comfortable at all) — but I suppose there wasn't much of a view to luxuriate in.

Arrived at 12pm I was told the official check in timing is 3pm.

We also enjoyed the boba tea workshop at Bob's bar with Nurul and Kennis (bubble tea served at Capella, who would have thought!). We were able to enjoy the pool and was warmly served by Sam.

Capella Singapore,Leaves much to be desired,"[Warning: Long review] TLDR: The Capella team did do a few unexpected things to delight customers, but there were far too many things that we felt were basic expectations that were simply unmet. My husband and I have travelled a good amount (pre-covid), at least enough to know how to tamper our expectations. We are also not ones to be overly critical or intentionally badmouth hospitality establishments, because we can appreciate how difficult it is to please customers and run a business of this scale. In fact, we hardly write reviews! But our stay at Capella compelled us to pen these thoughts simply because there were too many things left to be desired.

For our wedding, although there were plenty hiccups at the initial stages, but during the wedding reception itself, service from Cassia team (Bryan and team) was prompt and attentive, all our guests praised the food and service! The rest of the 3 nights we spent after the wedding was one of the best staycation we had for the past 2 years ever since the lockdown! Spacious room with great jacuzzi (we stayed in the constellation garden room - upgraded with Black discovery membership), beautiful pools (it’s like we are in bali!) and wonderfully green property with plenty of trees and plants everywhere we go.

Capella Singapore,A lovely family staycation at Capella,"I booked a staycation for 2 days, 1 night on Aug 14th to celebrate both my hubby and son's birthday. I was truly impressed with the level of service. The Culturist, Cheryl Kwan went above and beyond her duties to entertain both my kids. There was a bath bomb making class, which my son wanted to attend however was unable too as the class was already full. Cheryl took the effort to deliver bath bombs and cookies to my room just to cheer up my boy. She naturally has the X factor to work with kiddos. Another lovely soul whom I want to compliment is Mr.Saravana Kumar who was mending the pool. He made my son's day by suprising him with a cake at the poolside. Not only that.. he kept monitoring all the kiddos whether everyone was safe and kept entertaining the kids.

That said! Overall 5/5 because the overall service was impeccable. Highlights were Anil from the pool who offered great service and care.

Capella Singapore,Wonderful honeymoon staycation,"We had a most enjoyable staycation honeymoon at Capella Singapore and highly recommend the hotel. We chose Capella to ""getaway to nature"" as it offers a one-of-its-kind location in Singapore overlooking both lush green rainforests and beautiful blue sea. Although this is the most expensive hotel we ever stayed in, we feel that Capella offers excellent value for any special occasions: 1.

Capella Singapore,Singapore Farewell Staycation,"I’m not one to write reviews. I was even less prone to the idea of a “staycation”. However, when it was time for my husband and I to leave Singapore after living there for almost 4 years we thought - what a better goodbye than a weekend at the renowned Capella. I was skeptical at first because I never bought into the idea of a staycation. That didn’t last long, though. From the moment we stepped out of our car we felt that we had been transported to a high end paradise. We were greeted like royalty, then walked to our beautiful suite with a stunning view of the pool and tree tops (first row seats to birdwatching) and the sea at the background. Our room was huge, the bed humongous and super comfy! The bathroom was also big and super stylish.

Is it the high standard of service, or the high quality of fare? Is it the thoughtfulness and high attention to details of the Capella staff? Is it the luxurious and classy experience which never failed to revive our weary souls? I believe it is all of these reasons.

It's indeed like a home away from home, the villa (no.8) other than a luxurious set up, it is also a well thought out, well featured and practical design. Other than the room, the landscape is so well done that one feel that this is situated at somewhere (Bali?) but in Singapore. So it is so worth my paid value to stay there instead of having to fly to some foreign country. Thus, the costs and time for a local Sigaporean is every bit worthwhile to spend at Capella for such 'rejuvenating' vacation. Thank you Mei Ping, Fernando and team for such a wonderful experience.

Capella Singapore,Shockingly poor customer service,"A massive disappointment - I booked the Capella for the whole family (5 of us) to celebrate my wife’s 50th birthday (20/21 March). If you’re looking for excellent customer service then go to Raffles where we celebrated my birthday last year in great style and with perfect service. At Capella (which was even more expensive), we received a cold welcome, a disaster at breakfast the following day (which wasted two hours of our morning) and the hotel double blocked my credit card, making it go over my limit and causing other transactions to be cancelled. Multiple requests for a senior manager to call me afterwards yielded zero response.

Capella Singapore,Capella- the only hotel for me in Singapore,"We booked a one bedroom villa for 3 nights. Instead of detailing the hardware, i’d document my typical day at Capella. But first, let me say that breakfast at the Knolls was good. Damage was $48++. The ala-carte buffet concept was a good idea as the quality was preserved. The scrambled eggs and avocado toast were awesome and the best i’ve had in a hotel. However, the spread is not great so i only did brekkie once.

Capella Singapore,A nice weekend staycation!!,"I stayed at the Capella on Sentosa Island for 2 nights in November with my partner. We stayed in a Villa with a private pool. We both absolutely loved the Capella. It is modern, lux and friendly. The villa had the most amazing tech details… everything controlled by buttons on a control panel by the bed. Separate aircon units in every room (bathroom/bed/living), 2 plasma TV’s (bed/living). All blinds were controlled by the panel too.. my partner who is a bit of a tech freak was over the moon. There was also a free mini bar and a Nespresso machine in the villa.. all the little details that makes it so much more luxurious. Having a wonderful terrace and a private plunge pool means it is difficult to drag yourself away from the privacy of your villa!

We stayed in a Garden Villa which was beautiful. We also enjoyed the small but convenient plunge pool that is a part of the villa. The concierge and front desk staff were especially helpful in arranging tickets and transfers. There were a few minor issues which given the expectations (and price) set by the Capella might need to be addressed. There were a few maintenance issues in the villa (top of the outdoor table melted by cigarettes, we need to clean out the pool ourselves when we arrived). There's also an odd design flaw in the villa which allows people walking by outside to see into a part of the outdoor shower/bathtub area.
