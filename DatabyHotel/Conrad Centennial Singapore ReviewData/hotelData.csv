Conrad Centennial Singapore,"Doesn't really stand out - but good, solid hotel and great value.","A couple of stays in January. Front counter management is a bit off - there was always a wait-time during check-in/out, not due to crowd, but just not having the right number of people out there. There was also a few misunderstandings by their staff the complimentary benefits (e.g. pressing - housekeeping was trying to charge me but was corrected by Hhonors lounge manager). But....once you get hold of them, all the staff members sincerely were eager to please and all provided a high level of authentic and warm service. By Singapore's standard, the hotel is a bit dated. I think they realized it, and are renovating accordingly. Rooms are reasonable in size - luxurious enough, without being pretentious.

Conrad Centennial Singapore,Great Hotel,"Stayed here for 3 nights with my boyfriend who is a Diamond Member. Therefore we had an upgraded room- beautiful view, lots of lovely modern features such as the button to open and close the blinds without leaving the room, and the huge luxurious bathroom. I think they are refurbishing the pool area/executive lounge this month so this review might not apply. The executive lounge on the pool floor was well stocked. My only complaint, and this may not bother anyone else, was that it was very cold with the air con and I personally would have preferred a seating area outside where we could enjoy the refreshments (much like the Hilton Hotel in Bangkok for example) The pool area was large, although in April it did not get sun until after 11am, but once it arrived there was enough",5 out of 5,April 2018,5.0 of 5 stars,#38 of 373 hotels in Singapore,0.11228571428571428,0.5419047619047619,55.614285714285714,54.19047619047619,11.228571428571428,Amenities

However, there was nothing in this stay I guess check-in time was late. Instead, pretty Conrad bear and duck could be received. There was an outdoor swimming pool, and at night we saw Singapore Flyer shining beautifully. The temperature of the pool was a little cold, and very young children were not good at playing.

Conrad Centennial Singapore,Better than ever!,"I reviewed the Conrad centennial about a year ago. That time my main complaint was that after over 20 years of operation the place, especially the guest rooms, started to feel worn and torn. The crispiness was missing. This is natural and management was well aware of it, indeed the renovation was already planned at the time. Now a year later it was time to (literally!) revisit the Conrad centennial. All the things that I got to love about this place was as good as ever if not even better. The very friendly and professional service must be mentioned first.

Conrad Centennial Singapore,An excellent hotel in a great location,"My colleague and I stayed at the Conrad Centennial in Singapore during a recent work trip. The hotel was chosen as it is a Conrad brand which always guarantees great service and style. The Conrad is in a great location for exploring Singapore. With Suntec City mall beside the hotel and a quick 10 minute walk to the Marina, the hotel provides the best mix of proximity while not being too centralised.

The hotel is conveniently located in Suntec City in walking distance to Marina Square Mall and Suntec Mall as well as the Esplanade and Merlin which is on the far side exit of Marina Sqaure Mall.

Conrad Centennial Singapore,Conrad Excellence with views,"Conrad hotels you always know what you are getting, a solid luxury hotel. This was a nice surprise to get upgraded to the Executive floor with the lounge, which has to be one of the best lounges at a hotel I've been in anywhere. The staff are so very attentive, the food/drinks/space is very nice and no crowd. It gets busy for breakfast, but always a place to sit and enjoy the views. The hotel itself is centrally located and easy to get around Singapore. The rooms are very large and everything is very clean and the decor is modern along with the amenities. The shower has amazing pressure - an important item for traveling. I didn't get a chance to use room service, so i can't tell you that - but the food in the lounge was great, so I'd assume it to be good.

Nespresso machine in the room. Service is friendly and efficient. Sundowner drinks and snacks in the lounge each afternoon that made our stay special. The food at the sundowners as well as the breakfast seems to work on standard items with one or two which get changed every other day. If you are staying longer than two nights it gets repetitive. The breakfast does need more variety......perhaps fried rice and other Asian dishes.

Conrad Centennial Singapore,Water and service is scarce,The service in the hotel is mediocre- the food is average. And they definitely do NOT give you the sense of the “luxury of being yourself” nor to “stay inspired” I had put my team in this hotel for an event we were organizing. Had a lot of issues with the booking but the worse thing we experienced was the lack of water. The bottled water is tiny. My team had asked for water to be sent up- albeit they asked for 20 bottles which they did send the 1st 2 nights - on the 3rd night the front desk- rejected their requests- threatened to charge (to which I replied I was happy to pay) and then limited them to 6 bottles that night. Singapore is hot and humid and one would require lots of water to stay hydrated.

Conrad Centennial Singapore,Ok but not same as other Conrads,"We stayed for over a week with the kids in 2 rooms. Having stayed 3 weeks earlier (without kids) at the Mandarin Oriental, I had a good reference point. The Conrad hotel is recently renovated so rooms are nice quality. We stayed in Executive level rooms, which was nice until they closed the Hilton Honors lounge and those people had to come up to Level 31 to use the Executive Lounge. Unfortunately there clearly is not enough room for both so we had to wait repeatedly for a place to sit and then had to share tables. This was very disappointing as we’d paid for the use of the lounge and couldn’t enjoy it. Food range is more limited and much lower quality than Hong Kong and Tokyo Conrads. Its ok, but not in same category. In the end we gave up going to the lounge.

Conrad Centennial Singapore,"An old friend, refreshed and glowing.","I love this hotel. It has been a part of my business life, for decades, and I rate it as my favourite hotel, anywhere. It has not always been perfect, and we have had our ‘moments’ but the quality, service and simple feeling of “coming home”, make me one of its strongest advocates. I had stayed away during the renovations, as I’m very intolerant of disruption, but delighted to return last week and experience it’s new shine. The new room layouts I think are great, practical, comfortable and generous in space.

Conrad Centennial Singapore,Always a favourite in Singapore,"We have stayed here twice before and this time didn’t disappoint as usual. We had a king room on level 16 overlooking the Merlion. Staff are all generally attentive and efficient. There was an international trade conference on at the time of our stay so there were many “important people” in the lobby and lining up for the lifts .. much too important for lowly tourists! This happens in any good hotel. What we particularly like about this hotel is the easy connection to the nearby Suntec City and Marina Square malls. Heaps of shopping and eateries, all under cover and protected from Singapore’s afternoon thunderstorms! It’s also not too far to walk around to the Marina Shoppes for some serious high end purchases.

It’s close to a MRT station and Singapore probably has one of the best underground train systems in the world - high frequency, elaborate, and clean.

Conrad Centennial Singapore,Excellent Experience turned bit sour at Checkout,"This was my first stay experience with Conrad. I was here to attend a business conference for 3 days. The experience was immaculate right from check in until checkout. The staff at the checkout was not truly helpful as the hotel charged $200 on my card as a security. On checkout they mentioned that would like to physically see the credit card, which I had left in my office.

Conrad Centennial Singapore,a great find in Singapore!,"There are simply too many hotels in Singapore, and I've stayed at quite a few too. If you are looking for prime location, comfortable room, good service and good value for money, this is it! The hotel is 20 years old, however rooms have just been renovated earlier in 2018. Buffet breakfast was high in quality. I'm a very fussy eater and usually don't have anything else than fresh fruits and yogurt unless it is really good.

When I returned in November '18 after a long hiatus, I was absolutely blown away by the improvements they have made. The rooms and bathrooms are modernized, spacious and exquisitely appointed. There are numerous amenities including plush slippers and robes. The room was as quiet as a mouse and I slept like a baby. The pool and deck are large and inviting; an outdoor oasis right in the midst of the booming city. The staff simply could not have been nicer or more efficient, particularly at the Executive Lounge, which is 5+ Star.

Speaking of cabs, it's a 15-20 minute ride from SIN and it costs 20-30 Singapore Dollars depending on whether you have to pay the toll leaving the airport.  There's a bunch of nearby restaurants and bars plus a lot of shopping in the nearby Suntec City.  Do note that restaurants seem to close by 9:30 PM around here. Hotel: I love Asian Conrads and this hotel fits ranks with the best of them.  There's a large lobby with a small piano bar, a restaurant that has outdoor seating and does breakfast and dinner and two executive lounges: one on the 31st floor and",5 out of 5,December 2018,5.0 of 5 stars,#38 of 373 hotels in Singapore,0.29195767195767197,0.45873015873015877,64.5978835978836,45.87301587301587,29.195767195767196,Location

Conrad Centennial Singapore,Wonderful Hotel,"We stayed in the deluxe room which was spacious and very comfortable. Breakfast had a good variety. We had to que everyday for breakfast and would suggest that the breakfast time close at 11am instead of 10:30 during peak times, as some mornings we would only be seated after 10am leaving very little time for us to enjoy the buffet.

I could have taken a king room with harbour view but it was right next to the elevator...so instead settled for a twin facing the city.

We had an executive floor room and enjoyed the wonderful 31st floor lounge for afternoon tea and evening drinks. We preferred breakfast at Oscars because we could sit outside and enjoy the warm morning air. My only criticism of the hotel is that I felt the decor of our room was very bland and didn’t feel luxurious for a top range room. The carpet was pale and looked a little stained - though that might be the pattern! I remember the rooms feeling much more glamorous last time I visited. Gym is great here and I like the pool set up.

Conrad Centennial Singapore,"Beautiful hotel with spacious rooms, outstanding service and great location","We stayed at the Conrad Centennial Singapore three times over two months and enjoyed our stay every time. We found the rooms to be wonderful. They were spacious, with a very comfortable bed, a large, beautiful marble bathroom and good views. The service is what you would expect from a top notch hotel: outstanding. The location is also excellent. It is next to three shopping centers so there is a huge variety of dining close by. It is also close to most tourist attractions and a block away from the Metro to get to those that are a little further. There are two executive lounges, one next to the pool and one on the top floor. They serve a very good breakfast, with a chef station for egg dishes. Tea is very nice, and cocktail hour is fabulous.

I had ordered two dozen roses from the hotel in a basket for my beautiful wife wishing her a happy honeymoon they were beautiful, the hotel added a tray of chocolate that said congratulations neither one of us cared for the chocolate but it was a nice thought. This hotel is showing some age but is still very beautiful and in a great location. The staff was friendly and the Sunday brunch was fantastic at Oscars.

I never thought I’d detract stars from one of my favorite hotels in the world, especially not now, after renovations and the addition of the business lounge, but on arrival, we were very firmly and clearly offered a refresher room by the person checking us in. When departing, this offer was rescinded (it wasn’t even our suggestion in the first place, it was the initiative of the person checking us in, and so we planned our last day in Singapore accordingly) and to our surprise we were only given access to the level 4 lounge, with horrible, screaming children everywhere.

Conrad Centennial Singapore,Outstanding Service From Check In To Check Out,"Apologies for the delayed review! From the moment I walked in to the moment I walked out, the service and hospitality was faultless.

After she promptly went through the details of checking in I asked for directions to the nearest food court. She was able to clearly direct me towards where I wanted to go, for those who have not been to the Suntec area, it can get pretty confusing to navigate!

Conrad Centennial Singapore,Could be more Family friendly,"I stayed with my wife and 2 kids (aged 3 and 6). I understand that this is not necessarily the hotel's demographic, however I was still disappointed by a couple small incidents which made our stay slightly less pleasant than it should be. 1. The Executive Lounge (L4) - As Diamond members, we were hoping to be able to use the executive lounge in full, especially during the evening service.

Conrad Centennial Singapore,Fantastic refurbishments and great Executive Lounge,"Stop no. 2 for my mattress run was @ Conrad Centennial Singapore, which I've stayed twice pre-furbishment.

Conrad Centennial Singapore,Very nice lounge,"First time staying at Conrad Singapore, room is upgraded to premium king but I don’t know what’s the difference compared with deluxe room as all the rooms should be renovated already. Room size is fair, I requested a room facing MBS but it’s difficult to see it as there is another hotel just in front. But overall design and maintenance is good due to new renovated. The bear is not the new design one, when I asked they also said that they don’t have it, not sure how to get the new one. Executive lounge service is good, both cocktail and food is excellent. Probably one of the best lounge I’ve ever went. Swimming pool is also very nice. The location is very convenience, and there is a big shopping mall just in front of it.

Conrad Centennial Singapore,"Great Service, Convenient but Somewhat Noisy Location","I booked a premium king room with breakfast. I enjoyed my stay. Pros: ***Customer service was excellent. Staff was responsive to my requests and promptly dealt with an issue with my room. ***Room was spacious and nicely appointed. ***Location was within 2 minutes walk to MRT. Gardens by the Bay/Bugis is one stop away. Chinatown is four stops away. There are three malls nearby with food courts, a supermarket and a 7-Eleven next door where you can buy a tourist SIM card for cheap. ***Breakfast was ok. Given so many food places within a few minutes away, it's cheaper to eat offsite. Cons: ***Hotel is located across from bars that have licenses to play live music until 11pm, so I found out.

Check in was swift and smooth, and we have nothing but words of praise for the excellent service provided by all staff (from the concierge to the housekeeping team). Our room overlooked the Suntec Fountain of Wealth and the Sports Hub, and it was indeed a view to behold both day and night.

Conrad Centennial Singapore,Great location and fantastic staff,"This was the start location for our Far East holiday and it didnt disappoint. Prior to arriving I was invited to upgrade 1 level with a further guaranteed upgrade to executive floor (I am a Hilton gold member). I took advantage of this offer and am glad I did as I was able to enjoy a relaxed breakfast in the exec lounge and lots of complimentary champagne each evening. The hotel is near to the MRT. A high room is great - we were on 28th floor and had great views over the bay. Our room was large and very well equipped. Great TV, regular fresh water, large bed and well equipped bathroom with a good range of quality toiletries. We mainly dealt with the exec floor staff who were all brilliant.

Conrad Centennial Singapore,Fantastic Family Stay,"Stayed here for two nights in June 2019. I reserved two regular connecting rooms for my family (1 King connecting to a double). As a Hilton gold I was upgraded to Superior rooms before stay. I previously asked for early check in and we arrived before 9am on a weekday. Our bags were whisked away quickly from the Grab and there was no line for check in. They were able to get us in to one of our rooms right away with the other being ready at 3pm. Considering the early hour, I was delighted. The upgraded room came with breakfast at either Oscars or 4th floor lounge next to pool. We also were given 20% off other F&B except room service and $20 credit towards laundry per night. Wifi was free as well. We had rooms 2112 and 2110 and they were great.

Conrad Centennial Singapore,Excellent Hotel near Marina Bay,Booked this hotel through Luxury Escapes. This hotel has been recently refurbished. We had a deluxe room but had club room access with our package. The room was of a high standard. Very clean and comfortable and lovely bathroom. You have a partial view of Marina Bay but still a nice view from your room. Club room on the 31st floor was small for the number of guests. There is another lounge on the 4th floor which is more family friendly but for a club lounge people prefer the view and quiet on the 31st floor. This lounge needs to be bigger to accomodate but staff worked extremely hard to serve and help people with seating. Food standard was good and all day beer and wine.

Conrad Centennial Singapore,Working hard in a crowded market.,"Returned to the Conrad after a couple of years absence, been at the Fairmont, and pleased to say it has retained the quality and welcome I remember. Despite saying I was booked in an executive room I was checked in downstairs and advised as Gold I had been upgraded to an Executive Room? When I mentioned I had booked one the information paper was swiftly changed for another, just wonder if there is a difference in the facilities offered? Never mind room was good with, a sort of, view of the Marina. Spacious and well presented as one would expect. My only comment would be that the bench seating running all the way along the window wall was extremely uncomfortable, the lights under looked great at night, but I would much prefer an easy chair or settee to fall into to relax.

Conrad Centennial Singapore,Amazing Service and Great Location,"Conrad Centennial was exactly what we were looking for for our stay in Singapore. It was close to everything; with the Promenade MRT station across the street. A tip - when exiting MRT station, always look for exit B to get to the hotel since you can easily end up on the other side of the Suntec mall and a long walk back to the hotel. It took us few days to figure our way around the area. On our first day we purchased EZ Link cards and SIM cards at the 7-Eleven, one minute walk from the hotel. Being so close to the Suntec City mall gave us lot of shopping and dining options. We had an executive room on the 29th floor. The room had sufficient storage space and once we rearranged few things it gave us enough space to enjoy our 11-day stay.

Conrad Centennial Singapore,Never lets me down,"Have cumulatively spent months in Singapore for a combo of work and pleasure, and since staying at the Conrad Centennial it has never given me a reason to stay elsewhere. Given Singapore's relatively compact size and resultant short inter-city travelling distances, you could be forgiven for thinking that getting the location of your hotel right isn't a huge deal. Given SG's famous humidity, a 5 or 10 minute walk outdoors can destroy you if you're not used to it. Conrad though is 30 seconds from an MRT station entrance, and also literally seconds away from walking into Suntech Centre which is one of the best plazas in SG with a huge range of shops and restaurants. There's also plenty of other bars and restaurants sitting right outside the Conrad.

Staff at Westin club seemed friendlier yet at a high standard. I hope that makes sense but it really depends on your preference and what type of traveling your doing and your personality.

Except for one obvious flaw, the TV was on one side of the bed. My wife, sleeping on the other side had difficulty seeing the TV across me. TiV should always be at the leg end of the bed. The light switches were well designed and easy to use. The curtain is electrically controlled which was a great feature. Bathroom towels and consumables were good.

The lobby has some great art and architectural features as well. Dinner and breakfast at Oscar’s was great. It’s a buffet and it is well worth the money. Plenty of options to choose from, both culturally as well as type. Seafood, meats, noodle station, salads, and a dessert bar! If you have a room with lounge/club access then make sure to visit it.

Conrad Centennial Singapore,Differing guests rates questionable but still value for money,"Book through a certain agency and it is possible to have a 4 day/3 night stay at the Conrad for A$999. The package includes renovated Deluxe King room, breakfasts, VIP access to Executive Lounge, a free dinner in the Golden Peony Restaurant and other perks the agency claims add up to a value of $3.187. My wife and I missed the time slot for the above package and so for our 4 day/3 night stay we paid the full rate of $1200. For this there was no breakfasts and none of the other executive perks. I am not familiar with the finances of running a hotel but can it be said full rate guests are subsidizing the package guests?

The other thing, very different from other executive lounges in hotels around the world was you were not allowed to take a drink to your room at the end of the night.

Not sure if it was because we were luxury escape customers but I felt we were given a lower level room despite the fact that we had paid for a Club Executive king room. The Club Lounge was over crowded and definitely did not feel exclusive. Food was average. Can’t say there was anything special you would die for unlike the last time. Last time every breakfast, afternoon tea and cocktail hour spreads were a visual feast this time nothing looked incredibly enticing. Last time they even had their own hand made chocolates.

Conrad Centennial Singapore,"Convenient Location, Comfortable Rooms, Excellent Service","My wife and I stayed here for 3 nights during our honeymoon in November 2019. We've traveled extensively around the world, but have never been to Singapore. The hotel is conveniently located near shopping centers and public transportation. You will likely have to walk a bit to most areas, but there are plenty of indoor malls and passages that you can cut through in the area. It was also easy to book a Grab or taxi. The rooms are comfortable and our corner king offered a great view of the Marina area. While you can't see the Marina Bay Sands directly due to a building in the way, you are able to get quite a nice view of the gardens and surrounding buildings. The beds are standard to Conrad hotels around the world and excellent for recovery after a long flight.

Conrad Centennial Singapore,Good decision!,"We stayed at the Conrad because this is where my husband is always billeted when he’s in Singapore for work. He told me that he was pleasantly surprised when a couple of the staff at the lounge greeted him warmly. (Not a surprise that they were Filipino). It was my first time there and the experience was pleasant and memorable. The room was good-sized, smelled good and well appointed. I like that they had a Nespresso machine. There were complete amenities and everything was clean and orderly. The lobby is beautiful, even more so with the Christmas decor. We stayed there with two other friends and they too were quite happy with the accommodations. We also liked that there were good restaurants close by.

I have been here since 23 December for a family reunion, and in that time I have had two nights of decent sleep - only because I used my painkillers, which I hate to do. It seems impossible to talk to anyone in management, and the front line staff just keep adding extra soft doona-like pads, which exacerbate the problem, as they all collapse and I end up sleeping in a sagging but hard bed. Last night in desperation we removed a lot of it and added another foam pad that we purchased, and I got some sleep. The next morning, as we have each day, I begged them for a proper mattress topper.

Conrad Centennial Singapore,An elegant and comfortable hotel,We stayed here for 5 nights in late February. From the moment we arrived the staff were amazingly helpful and always went out of their way to ensure we had everything we needed. Our room on the 28th floor was large and had a spectacular view of the Marina Bay area. The bed was so comfortable. The room had everything we needed for our stay and was spotlessly clean The hotel was elegant with many lounge areas. We had booked with luxury escapes and had the benefit of using the executive lounge. The afternoon tea and evening dishes were very tasty.

The bathroom was very nice and modern. Despite some small complaints, the room was overall nice and as expected from a Conrad. I visited the pool as well which was not crowded and a decent size.

Conrad Centennial Singapore,Excellent accomodation but club lounge below par,"We stayed a few days as a stopover on our way to New-Zealand. Our Marina Bay view room was on the 24th floor with access to the executive lounge on the 31st floor. Our room and bathroom were perfect with limited traffic noise, it did not affect our night sleep. The 20 meter outdoor pool was perfect for a swim. The lounge however was below par. The canapes served in the lounge were not tasty at all, they were usually preparations of chicken; the desserts were greasy (hence our median rating of ""Service""). We had our daily buffet breakfast in Oscar's. Some breakfast items in Oscar's were relatively limited, e.g. fresh fruits except when you like melon; there was some choice of dairy products.

Conrad Centennial Singapore,Outstanding,"The Conrad is a real classy hotel. The staff are really friendly and accommodating. Due to the current low occupancy, the check in staff readily gave us early check in and late checkout which was much appreciated. The quality of the room was outstanding. Even the basic room here feels like a mini suite in other hotels. I especially enjoy their bathroom amenities, the Shanghai Tang toiletries in particular are really high quality. The bed was especially comfortable. Some hotel beds feel impossible to fall asleep on. This was the complete opposite... it felt impossible NOT to fall asleep on. Fantastic quality.

The ballroom was perfect. it could hold a large number of guests, the interior deco and chandeliers were beautiful, and we were told they had new screens. other hotels we later went to, just to do our due diligence, couldnt hold a candle to conrad's ballroom. we soon booked our wedding dates for january 2021. when covid hit, we were naturally very concerned about our wedding. however, Crescent really did an amazing job to keep us updated and",5 out of 5,January 2021,5.0 of 5 stars,#38 of 373 hotels in Singapore,0.35361781076066795,0.4821273964131107,67.6808905380334,48.21273964131107,35.3617810760668,General

Check In was smooth, i realised none of the check in & check out staff carry any name tag hence cant comment on anyone in particular. Really enjoyed our lounge experience, high tea was quite empty hence service was great. However, as we are limited to a strict 1 hr only in lounge, we will get rushed to make a ""last order"" after 45mins. Wished we werent rush out as the lounger was barely full, but i guess that's just their SOP. Wery diff to other hotels nearby where they are more flexible with timing during lounge hours. Bed was comfy, room size decent. Breakfast at Oscar was extremely average though, we are allowed 1 order of the main only per pax, hence its not really ala carte buffet per se.

Conrad Centennial Singapore,Superb Wedding Dinner experience with Conrad,"We had our solemnisation at Conrad back in January 2021 and just this week we were back again for our wedding dinner banquet at their Grand Ballroom. We chose Conrad for many reasons and had a great experience with them. We loved the ballroom (high ceiling, pillar-less and nice chandeliers). The dinner food, prepared by their award winning restaurant Golden Peony, was really good. During our food tasting, the team at Conrad was very meticulous, their chef even joined us at the end of the tasting for feedbacks. Our guests had commented that they enjoyed the food very much and that the servings were very generous. We'd like to compliment our wedding co-ordinator and banquet manager.

The room amenities, linen and towels remained the same as per normal stay. Request for utilities was quickly met. With 3 meals in bento sets prepared by the chef, these were sumptuous.

Couples who book Ballroom will need to stay at another hotel suite. The contract agreement are not to the favour of couple as review of agreement will be only 2-3 months before event date. Cancellation policy is not favourable to couples as well. Along with the inconvenience for being a SHN hotel, there is no additional incentive given to affected couples.

No harm trying, I checked in at Conrad Centennial on eve of Christmas. And all I did was eat, watch TV and I had a great night sleep for over 10hrs for 2 nights in a row! I don't know why.

Conrad Centennial Singapore,Wedding,"Attended my friend’s wedding on 12 Feb 2022 & as a bridesmaid and coordinator for the day, I would like to especially thank Imran (banquet manager) for being such a great person to work with. Imran has been so comforting towards the couple and reassuring them that they are all well. As a first time coordinator, I’m very anxious that things does not go well but he was always there helping and guiding me throughout the event. He has been so accommodative and with his humorous jokes, it definitely calm me and the couple down. I couldn’t emphasize how fantastic he was. Alongside with his other team members (AV, hotel managers & staff) I’m deeply appreciative of your services and each of you made such a memorable day for me and the couple.

We were attended to by Peggy at the front desk and she was so friendly and helpful. She made sure we got a good room and also ensured to explain to us every detail that we needed for our stay. The room itself was beautiful, clean and spacious. I was so delighted to find a cute conrad bear and some cookies and last but not least a cute rubber Ducky!!

The lobby was beautifully decorated with art and was exactly what I would expect from a luxury hotel like Conrad.

The only downside is that the hotel bar closes early, around 10:30pm. I am used to hotel bars staying open until at least 1 or 2am.

Conrad Centennial Singapore,Not all that impressed,"Just checked in this morning after a very long trip from YYZ. Got to the hotel at around 830am. Luggage carted off. Checked in. Was given no information on room service, breakfast options. Room on 13th floor. Small...showing wear and tear. Mattress on one bed is lopsided. Had requested 2 bears in room but only one. When requested at front desk later, was given 2nd bear and duck. Luggage took forever and had to call to find out where it was. Ice and water requested, delivered promptly. Checked out pool. Kids got in but snooty woman told off younger one for jumping into pool near her as it splashed her. Bearing in mind, hes 10 and she was sitting on lounge chair at least 6 ft away from him.

Seems like they were very protective about the lounge and claimed that it would be full We had to convince them if we could buy lounge access for our parent's room, but they recommended we should not since it's not worth it. And we understood why.

Conrad Centennial Singapore,Grand Asian Landmark with all the Fine Hallmarks of a Great Hotel.,"True Hospitality in a Beautiful Hotel. I love everything about this hotel. The place is grand in scale, with a soaring Lobby, wide hallways and large rooms. The staff is finely trained and never miss an opportunity to acknowledge their guests, open doors, use names and engage in polite conversation. All the grand hotel touches are evident. Generosity in all offerings, most especially in the breakfast, tea service and cocktail hours in the Executive Lounge. In my opinion, excellent value in the additional cost. Location is very convenient, being away from the hustle of Orchard Road but close to, far enough away from Marina Bay. On MRT and bus routes, and with several malls and countless restaurant options at all price points within walking distance.

I was in an executive king room and it was excellent. Very spacious with a nice bathroom also. Everything you need in the room. Had the executive lounge privilege. The sheet they give you at check in says you have to make a reservation for both high tea and happy hour.

On one hand, the hotel is located in a prime location with easy access to shopping and dining options.

The hotel staff were polite and friendly, and the turn-down service in the room even provided ice without request. However, apart from these positive aspects, my overall impression is that this Conrad hotel is currently undergoing cost-cutting measures, and the service has significantly declined. They are very stingy in various aspects. This is the worst Conrad hotel I have ever stayed in.

This request was denied “when you check out at 2 pm you need to leave the hotel, you can’t stay in the lounge.” Because I had luggage and my airline flight’s check in counter doesn’t open until 3 hours before departure, I sat in the Changi ticketing hall for hours.

In the lounge, I requested for the late check out due to the meetings, due to the summer vacation my room couldn't be extended for the late check out. Joyce tried her best to coordinate with the duty manager and help me to complete the ""mission impossible.""

Conrad Centennial Singapore,An amazing stay!,"Absolutely phenomenal experience. Everything was perfect. The service- exceptional. Every single person I came across greeted me. Those in higher positions spoke with me, how was your day? Offered tips to see different things. Cleaning staff would stop what they are doing and greet me. I loved my welcome basket. We got an array of chocolates and nibbles, along with drinks and a lovely personal welcome card. The room- I was fortunate enough to be upgraded to a corner suite. I got a complete lounge and separate bedroom. It was incredibly spacious and the views were incredible. The bed was extremely comfortable and the amenities were wonderful. I even had a Dyson hair dryer in the room! I loved how the deep bathtub can with a rubber ducky and bath salts. The breakfast was great",5 out of 5,August 2023,5.0 of 5 stars,#38 of 373 hotels in Singapore,0.49263038548752835,0.6959183673469389,74.63151927437642,69.59183673469389,49.26303854875284,Services

Conrad Centennial Singapore,"5-star hotel, really?","I was at your bar on 7 Oct 23 for a late night snack, and there was an event going on at the second floor. The noise insulation was so bad that it was hard to have a conversation, not to mention that the ambience is unbecoming of a 5 star hotel. We ordered satay which came in a disposal cardboard tray -- this made us feel that we are in a hawker center with a nearby 7-month getai, except that the price is much higher. And your waiter cleared our remaining satay WITHOUT asking for our approval. And by the way, please remind your workers to conduct themselves properly in the toilet (next to Oscar's). What happened to you, Conrad? You were not like that pre-covid.",1 out of 5,October 2023,5.0 of 5 stars,#40 of 372 hotels in Singapore,-0.13055555555555556,0.2787037037037037,43.47222222222222,27.870370370370367,13.055555555555557,Value
