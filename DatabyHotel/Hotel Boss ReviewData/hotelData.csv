Hotel Boss,"Good price with pool, gym and restaurants (including halal ones)","Stayed with family in two rooms which were, quite frankly, tiny but functional - small fridge, big windows, area to hang clothes and accommodate small luggages, desk and some drawers, one side table with storage space underneath etc Bathrooms were small too but it has adequate space for shower cabin, shelf for toiletries, sink with adequate space for other toiletries and makeup stuff ( very important for ladies). Ironing facilities are provided in a separate place. The only reason why I’m deducting one star is the room size - if you come with large luggages, as people normally do when travelling Asia, you might want to consider a much bigger than their standard room which will cost more I imagine.

Hotel Boss,Average Hotel,"Staycation for 3 days 2 nights in superior balcony. Room was small but fine for me. Very basic room amenities. Cleanliness is so so. Ants on dressing table, so can't put food there. Toilet has a kind of smell and no bidet! No toilet paper rolls, just small tissues. The balcony has no privacy as mine was facing to other rooms and no views. I like that there's smart tv in the room with you tube app as there'was just local channels to watch. Wifi was good.

Noise with echo can project from this inward area, which I could also hear in the middle of night with a group of people talking and laughing. Is more light a chalet rather a hotel.

When you call front desk they say shortage of staff rooms are too small bathroom are too small just like a public bathroom . Although public bathrooms are much better . No jet in toilets . One thing good close to Indian restaurants that is why deserves one star some booking sites are predicting 4star but I will rate it as Sarai . Better to spent some more money and opt for better hotel. After placing beds in room not a inch place left for moving. Worst ever hotel I have visited on abroad from india.room size 10*8.

Hotel Boss,Worst Experience in my life with hotel and its services.,This review m writing while I stay at hotel and based on my current feeling. If you have choose to be in this hotel while seeing all the photos of property then let me tell you the worst ever hotel I have seen at this price without basic amenities like cupboards and correct size bed. M living with my daughter here and the bed size is too small to adjust because I have paid full in advance I do not have any other option but to adjust but this is completely mood spoiler same food for breakfast since 4days and another 4days I have to bare the same. If you any anything it will come after 2-3 hours and most of the time they will not respond. Because it is a big hotel they give this service. Choose any bed and breakfast motel instead of going for this one.,1 out of 5,November 2022,3.0 of 5 stars,#93 of 372 hotels in Singapore,-0.03124999999999999,0.3499999999999999,48.4375,34.99999999999999,3.124999999999999,Value
Hotel Boss,Not very good experience,"1. Very small room, it is like matchbox. Mat only work for a single person. 2. They don't clean the rooms unless you request for it . 3. Very little option for vegetarians in breakfast. A big hotel like this should have balanced menu / options for both vegetarians and non-vegeterians. 4. They don't pickup phone at the reception easily. You have to try many times. 5. Location of the hotel is good , very near to little India. 6. our Travels voucher says 150 Sqft room, but we were given 140Sqft room and additional 10 Sqft in this small room matters. 7.

Customer Service here is a bit hit or miss as some employees at the front desk could do better at communicating or take an extra step to check with their manager to confirm things. Hidayah Tiong: She needs a raise! She is a star employee at Hotel Boos.

It was in a perfect location with a bus stop right outside and a subway station 5 mins walk away that made it so easy to get to anywhere we wanted to go in the city quickly and easily. We booked a room that had a balcony and city view which was just absolutely breathtaking especially at night (pic from balcony included in this post!) The room itself was modern and comfortable - note that if you get just a normal queen room for 2 people, it’s a pretty tight space to move around especially with multiple suitcases!

I have asked for a 2 night refund as this is a basic provision. Despite contacting the reception desk on at least 4 occasions during this period; the hot water issue had not been resolved and we were not offered any alternative provision. On the first day of the issue they prepared a room for us to shower but after 90 mins of waiting; by that time most of us had mustered the courage to endure the cold shower. Even the new room they gave for us to shower had a blocked drain so the bathroom become flooded within a few minutes of the shower starting. The rooms are small, but beds are comfortable.

Hotel Boss,"Worst Service, Not Value For Money At All","My son and I had a very disappointing experience. We stayed here for three nights and had one of the worst experiences imaginable. There are numerous factors to consider before making a reservation at this hotel. To begin with, their rooms are not worth the money to be paid for the service provided. The front desk was unfriendly, not even greeting us or smiling when we checked in.   We have requested a higher floor so that we can at least have a view of the sky. Sadly, they provided us with a really cramped room on the lowest floor possible, which is level five. The view is just of a building, which is extremely dark with no lights.

Hotel Boss,Terrible!!,"We booked a city view room, we were expecting quite big a room but the room it was super small. Even we didn't have wardrobe. First day, housekeeping cleaned our room but not properly. She/ he didn't put towels. In the night, we wanted to drink a cup of tea. I checked the kettle it was not working. And I called the reception and asked new one. They sent us. But after this, I checked the cups, they didn't wash them. Second day, housekeeping they changed our bed sheets but I think they didn't wash them because the upper sheet it was so dirty. There was blood. On the table, under tv, there was full of insects or begbugs I am not sure for them. They bited us during staying. And finally, third day, before leaving from the hotel, we wanted to keep our luggage in the luggage room.

Hotel Boss,Avoid breakfast at all cost,Although in a central district the room and bathroom were so small . Whatever you do avoid booking breakfast as it was like a cattle market. No where to sit guests having to stand and eat. Staff were working hard to clear tables but there were nowhere near enough staff and no manager presence to oversee what was occuring. It was the worst experience we have ever had for a breakfast and food was basic and same each day.

There were people, luggages, etc every where. The lobby is always full of people mostly Indian and it us so noisy that you can hardly hear the concierge! Considering all this, they are quick to check you in! They however did not give us any information about the facilities.

Hotel Boss,"Dirty and noisy, avoid in my opinion","Avoid this place. I don’t usually review somewhere before checking out. This is the 18th hotel we have used at the end of an 8 week trip, and it’s the worst. I also note the majority of the 5 star reviews given to this place are by people with one contribution on Trip Advisor, so I’d doubt whether they are in fact genuine reviews. I booked this place as it purports to use the SG Clean Quality Mark. It is far from it. Check in was quick and we were allocated room 9-99. Apparently a superior room. As soon as we entered the room it smelled like someone had run around with a dirty mop. The seat in the room was dirty and there was dust around the floor edges. We were moved to 7-99.

Hotel Boss,Not value for money.,"We stayed in the hotel for four nights in August, 2023. Hotel location is very convenient as it is very near Lavender MRT station and also about 10-15 minutes walk from Little India. Room size was very small considering the price we paid per night, a little more than Rs.10,000/- per night ( Superior Double Room without breakfast). Also, the room had no almirah. It is a very big hotel in Singapore. We were really surprised when we entered such a small room allotted to us in 7th floor. The bed was also uneven. Plus points: Hotel reception gave additional bottled water on demand on most occasions. They had big locker room where you can put your luggage after checking out.

We knew the rooms would be small but they are like shoe boxes and are so basic and the walls are paper thin so you hear everything. The hotel is advertised as a mid range hotel, I have stayed in better travelodges With the exception of the cleaning staff the staff at this hotel are rude and curt and grunt at you rather than actually engage in any conversation with you The breakfast is poor and not great and feels like a school cafeteria with plastic plates and cups and signs up saying you will be charged for wastage.

Hotel Boss,Highly Recommended,"We were happy that our travel agent booked us at this hotel. The lobby was spacious with its beautiful chandeliers and with may sofa to sit while waiting for our guide The room was compact and cozy and it's truly a room with a view. However, because of the room size, it's not advisable to have more than 2 bags in the room. The room amenities were sufficient with tea coffee making facilities and complete toiletries were available. The staff were friendly and helpful. We lost our tour voucher and the front desk staff facilitated contacting our tour operator and requested for a fax of our tour schedule. The restaurant at the lobby served very tasty breakfast although it would have been better if they changed the menu daily.

Hotel Boss,Large Hotel Nightmare!,"What a terrible hotel, from the minute we arrived the lobby is like a bus terminal taken over by large tour groups. The hotel is far too big for its own good. With 100 rooms per floor. Housekeeping was atrocious, they could turn up anytime between 7am in the morning and 9pm at night. Some days the room wasn't even cleaned. The rooms are exceptionally small and look nothing like the pictures online. I had to move rooms several times due to noise from fellow guests. Staff are very unhelpful too.

Checking and check out was quick. The rook was neat and clean. The room is small but that's expected. The bed is a full queen. As someone who is 2m tall, having a full queen bed is important. A shorter queen bed, like at V Lavender, leaves my ankles hanging off. So I had a good nights sleep.

Breakfast daily, included in the price at time of booking, provided a variety of cuisine and topped up regularly - no excuse to go hungry here. You can also dine here for dinner if you desire. Tocha Bistro is only metres from the hotel lobby and has good daily deals on alcoholic drinks so you can certainly save a few dollars. Meals here are also worth trying.

Hotel Boss,Awesome stay,"Booking was very easy. No issues. Was getting time to time update. Hotel near to Lavender metro station. So many eateries at ground floor. We do have Indian cuisines. Very clean hotel. Only issue was not many varieties at breakfast. Bus stations just attached to hotel. Superb view of the city. Felt as if I had booked hotel in MG Road of India. Though rooms are small, they are very clean. Memorable experience. The entire country was wonderful. Lot to learn from them. Visit to Chinatown for shopping. My humble suggestion is to not visit Little India. You will forget the greatness of Singapore if you go there. Very untidy, they are very shaby,the environment is just opposite to other parts of Singapore.

Hotel Boss,Mixed Feelings About Our Stay at Hotel Boss,We were looking forward to our stay in a SUPERIOR room at Hotel Boss....the last stop before home. We arrived to a very manic & noisy Reception area and it was even difficult to hear the Receptionist at the Service Desk! The staff were very nice and they had listened to my request and given us a quiet room (Level 17) away from the lifts. When we arrived in the room I couldn’t believe that it was a SUPERIOR room as it was VERY small in size so I called down to Reception where I was informed that all SUPERIOR rooms were 44square feet in size and that we were. In the right room. There is no room to put your suitcases and you can barely walk around the bed. The decor is dark grey/ black and it is very claustrophobic! The bathroom though small again was clean and the shower was good.,3 out of 5,November 2019,3.0 of 5 stars,#93 of 372 hotels in Singapore,0.10056437389770721,0.5751631393298059,55.028218694885354,57.51631393298059,10.056437389770721,Services

Very nice outdoor swimming pool and a 24-hour gym. Room is a bit compact but size is fair enough for a mid-tier hotel. Toilet is clean as well. Staff are very friendly.

Ours wasnt that much bigger but not so chlastaphobic as we had the large balcony to use too. Breakfast was mainly indian food! Not quite what I fancy for breakfast so we made do with scrambled egg, sausage and toast and jam. Good location, close to a corner shop for goodies for the room and close to metro too to get anywhere within the city. We did the hop on hop off bus tour where we explored most of the sights of the city so definately a good idea if you want to see everything.

Hotel Boss,Upgrade to Premier if staying.,"The hotel is situated near the Little India part of Singapore. We stayed for 4 nights at this hotel. We took notice of the reviews before we went and upgraded to a premier room so that we had a reasonable space to stay in. I can confirm that the cheaper rooms are very small. We had very little interaction with the staff, but those we sought assistance from, were very helpful. The 18th floor room provided spectacular views of Singapore. We found the room quite nice, the furniture was of a good standard, and the bathroom was acceptable. Everything was clean. Again, having read the reviews we stayed well clear of the restaurant and found many cheap local places quite close by with good quality food at very reasonable prices.

Relatively convenient location to town and many attraction spots, & easy access to Changi airport as well. Many busses stop right at the hotel (there’s a busstop facing the hotel lobby at street level). Mrt (metro) is not far either.

We had a broken shower head bracket which was known to room service guy.

The hotel has a food court which has all sorts of cuisines at a very reasonable rate. Though rooms are small, it won't make much of a difference for tourists as the time they spend in room is going to be less. The beds were still spacious enough. We stayed in a triple room, which had a double bed and a single bed.Service by the staff was excellent. Check in and check out took just minutes. And the view from the room was simply breathtaking.

We were not informed that the pool and gym were not available before and after booking, nor informed upon checking in.

Have also seen group of families in their swimwear facing with disappointment at the pool area. Closing the facilities due to COVID19 measures shouldn't be a valid reason since most hotels have already open them up to the users.

Hotel Boss,A thorough review on my 3 day 2 nights at Hotel Boss (room with balcony),"Today is my last day of my staycation at hotel boss and i think i shall give my thoughts on this hotel. I booked the room with the balcony and my room is on the 14 floor. The view out of the balcony is pretty mediocre but in my opinion (FYI: the balcony have no privacy at all so PLEASE do not be in your birthday suit). Jokes aside, when i entered into the room the first time i was surprised that it was soooo small when i say small i meant really small but it isnt much of a problem. The cleanliness of the room i’d say is 4.5/5. The bed is decent size and comes with 2 pillow total one for me and one for my GF.
