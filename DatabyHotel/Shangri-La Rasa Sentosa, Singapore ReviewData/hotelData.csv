"Shangri-La Rasa Sentosa, Singapore",Perfect family stay.,We have just returned from our visit where we stayed for four nights and wished we could have stayed longer. We travelled with 3 adults and four kids and arrived early in the evening. On arrival the staff could not have been more helpful and friendly with smooth check-in and helping us to our room. They also suggested where we could take the kids for a quick dinner before restaurants closed which we were extremely grateful for. The breakfast buffet was fantastic so definitely include that in your package and having a designated kids selection is brilliant and not something I had seen before. We also enjoyed one of the evening buffets (chilli mud crab night) and I would highly recommend trying this.

"Shangri-La Rasa Sentosa, Singapore",A value for money hotel in Sentosa island at Singapore,We are a family of three and stayed at the Shangi-La for 6 nights during the easter break. The hotel is located at Sentosa island which is the home of many attractions at Singapore. Going to places in the island is pretty easy and free through a convenient bus transportation system. A free shuttle bus is available for the hotel guests from the lobby to the nearby ViVo City Mall where you can use the underground and go almost everywhere. The stuff is very friendly and kind doing their best to make your stay memorable.

Rooms clean and well appointed. Nice pool. This property is most definitely geared towards family and kids. I would rank the property as a solid four star hotel. While the staff were very attentive and warm, the hotel won’t match a very high end five star property.

The crowd is not too bad as it adds to the festive resort feel. We spent a lot of time at the pool and it did not feel too crowded. I must say their life guards are very pro active in calling out anyone who could be doing something dangerous or not attentive to young kids. There’s always something going on around the hotel be it pool activities or at the kids club. Service was really good all round except in F&B where it felt like they were understaffed. Buffet breakfast had a wide spread and got to love the kids corner where items were placed at the height for kids to help themselves. There was also a baby corner available.

"Shangri-La Rasa Sentosa, Singapore",Fantastic resort for families,"The hotel is located on Sentosa island, so already you are very close to tons of activities and attractions. The public transport arrangements on the island are excellent although it was very busy. The hotel has its own bus service but is also very close (2 mins walk) to the cable care station or the bus stop for the Sentosa island bus service. The beach is clean and large, although due to the refinery and ship yard being near by I suspect not many people choose to swim in the sea as I didn’t see anyone swimming during our stay. The hotel staff are fantastic. All from housekeeping to the duty manager couldn’t be more helpful and friendly. Customer service was exceptional.

"Shangri-La Rasa Sentosa, Singapore",extra costs charged to my card for using mobile check out and no refund after a week,Hi Tane I wanted to follow up on a conversation that i had with one of Rasa Sentosa's duty manager (Vin) last week relating to a wrong charge on my card for my stay at room 155 from 16th to 18th Mar. I understand from Vin that the wrong charge was due to the utilization of the mobile checkout function within the golden circle app and the difference would be refunded to me. However i have not seen the credit after a week and i would like to follow up to understand the reason for the delay. I'm very disappointed with the fact that it is taking more than a week to process a simple refund and this is after email exchanges and calls with the hotel's team.

"Shangri-La Rasa Sentosa, Singapore",Great staycation as always,"Stayed 4 nights under the Slice of fun package. Kids had an awesome time at the resort and everything was in right order. The only grouse we had was the shortage of parking spaces for hotel resident guests. Maybe hotel can allocate those parking spaces outside for those guests who came to attend dinners or functions and leave the spaces within carpark for hotel resident guests instead? As such event guests only park for the day whereas hotel residents will be overnight and it's a hassle to shift cars over the night. Other than this carpark issue, we are pretty much happy with the resort since we are long time guests of the resort since 2012!

"Shangri-La Rasa Sentosa, Singapore",Wonderful Staycation,"I have to admit, I was a little apprehensive about doing a staycation during covid but living and working in the same space had me crying out for a change of scenery. I chose the Sentosa hotel as I wanted to feel like I was away from SG and as a Golden Circle member it seemed crazy not to chose the Shangri-la. I'm so pleased to say it was a truly wonderful stay. From check-in to departure and everything in between was easy. Due to covid and the under occupancy, the hotel was busy but not crowed, so it had a great vibe (ie: it didn't feel like a ghost town or Picadilly Circus). The room was lovely with a great view and when the plug in the bath didn't work (it would close to retain the water) the hotel fixed it immediately.

Granted the Weather was rainy which was no fault of the hotel. but the service was nothing sort of disappointing. First, the reservation team gave us a lot of trouble with the booking. On arrival at the room, the bedsheets were stained. The next day we had to call the room service 3 times before someone came to clean the room after 3 pm. The room service was terrible— unfit for a 5 star hotel and not worth the price we paid.

Of course this isn't the Caribbean so it was full of tankers and ships occasionally blowing their horn but I found a certain charm in that. Particularly being able to work while gazing at the sea was very nice. We made all sorts of requests which the front desk met very well (and they even somehow guessed that I did not want a tub, and waived the extra charge to switch). A few things to note is that it is quite far from most things so getting around is difficult unless you drive. The shuttle to Harbourfront is useful but starts late at 11am.

"Shangri-La Rasa Sentosa, Singapore",Fell short of a 5 star experience.,"Previous reviewers have captured some of the positives very well. Staff were lovely, the pool area is nice, the breakfast was included and very good (multiple world cuisines), and the hotel has spacious, clean rooms. Ideally located next to the cable car terminal which was a lot of fun to ride, and close to Universal Studios etc. They allowed an early check-in due to availability, and the food/ drink quality at all locations was good - especially the Asian dishes but the Italian was good also. Downsides are not major derailers, and some cannot be changed by the resort, but they nudge the score down. The hotel is a large unattractive concrete building which must be nightmarish to maintain.

The travel agent I was using initially tried to place us elsewhere on Sentosa, a half hearted attempt saying that there were no rooms available on the dates i required, a quick check with the hotel direct and this proved to be not the case although there were only a handful left. I stuck to my choice and we managed to book two sea view rooms.

While the hotel looks a bit dated from outside - the interiors are fantastic. The pool areas are always packed full of activities. The staff is friendly and always willing to help out.

The hotel is very family friendly as there's a huge variety of activities for kids. My son had a great time at the Cool Zone when he got to do some art and crafts, and also some maze climbing. There was a slight mishap at the waterslide area as he swerved too fast and hit his head hard. The staff reacted promptly and gave directions for medical advice which was well appreciated.",5 out of 5,June 2023,5.0 of 5 stars,#13 of 16 hotels in Sentosa Island,0.23941666666666667,0.5054166666666666,61.97083333333333,50.541666666666664,23.941666666666666,Amenities
"Shangri-La Rasa Sentosa, Singapore","Well done Shangri-La Sentosa, you have our loyalty","5 out of 5. Exceptional check in and check out. Exceptional service recovery from an incident out of their control show the culture and standards here are the best in the world. When the Singapore government shut down power for annual testing from 11pm to 7am, the team with great care relocated us to Shangri-La Valley Wing in the CBD so I could achieve my meeting schedule and our young kids would be comfortable. Special mention to Vin the Front Desk manager and Kathleen Grace who checked us in. We live close by in Indonesia and will be back again soon.

"Shangri-La Rasa Sentosa, Singapore",Great place for families with young kiddies,"If you like the sun and sand.. This is a great place popular with families with young children to unwind and relax. However, there are very limited parking lots available and only 1 staff to manage the incoming cars at the main entrance .. Carpark was full at about 4pm and there was a long queue. And there are no security check at the carpark /beachfront facilities area to verify if you're a resident / event guest. Took the terrace room on a high floor. Very spacious.. Clean and comfortable.

"Shangri-La Rasa Sentosa, Singapore",Tardy business practices,"We had a great stay with one problem. On check-in we were charged $100 Singapore per day of stay for incidentals which was fine, however, getting the refund of unused funds is very tardy.

"Shangri-La Rasa Sentosa, Singapore",Wonderful Experience,"We took a cruise from Singapore and stayed at the Shangri La Rasa Sentosa for three nights before we left. It was a great way to adjust to the new time zone. There are lots of restaurants and both a beautiful beach and huge pool. There is also a free shuttle to the city, which we used, but didn’t really need to leave the resort! Everything we needed was there.

"Shangri-La Rasa Sentosa, Singapore","Fairly unremarkable, tired hotel","Stayed for 3 nights here and the location is about the best thing going for it - walking distance to the cable car and shuttle bus to all the Sentosa resorts. The hotel overall feels very tired and way overdue a refit, it looks on the outside like it was built in the 70’s and the rooms looked like they were last updated 20+ years ago. It’s also very expensive when you’re there - £12 for a large draft beer !! The breakfast was pretty good and so was the restaurant so that pulled it round a bit. We ate in the Italian restaurant which was 5 mins along the beach which was ok. The pool was unremarkable but there were always loungers available. If we were to go back to Sentosa we would definitely not stay here again and would try one of the other hotels on the island.",3 out of 5,July 2023,5.0 of 5 stars,#13 of 16 hotels in Sentosa Island,0.10561383928571427,0.40251488095238097,55.28069196428571,40.251488095238095,10.561383928571427,Location
"Shangri-La Rasa Sentosa, Singapore",The best resort for young families if your budget allows it,"We visited at the end of June with two 4 year olds & a 6 year old. We had the best time, absolutely loving our 6 night stay. We did not want to leave! Pros - Pool, pool slides & splash pad were perfect for young kids - Pool stays open late (great when you have jet lag) - Poolside activities such as face painting & balloon making - Kids club (drop off for over 5, although they let me drop off my 4 year olds too as they really wanted to hang with their big sister ) my kids loved it and asked to go everyday. - Food. Poolside dining was a huge hit for us. Enjoyed both buffet breakfast & dinner (tip - become a circle member online to redeem a 25% off voucher). One night we even had arm painting and a roaming magician to entertain the kids whilst we waited for food. - Guest",5 out of 5,July 2023,5.0 of 5 stars,#13 of 16 hotels in Sentosa Island,0.3366666666666667,0.5666666666666667,66.83333333333333,56.666666666666664,33.66666666666667,Amenities

"Shangri-La Rasa Sentosa, Singapore",Definitely aimed towards a holiday with children,Stayed here for 4 nights and it was a great location for exploring Sentosa. Go to the adults only breakfast on the 6 th floor for a delicious array of food and some peace and quiet. Very attentive and friendly service from the two lovely ladies Karen and her offsider. The hotel rooms are looking a little dated and unfortunately the bed mattress was very hard but they accommodated my concern by offering another topper pad which did help. Staff were generally friendly and helpful. Lifeguard in attendance and games arranged at regular times for the kids at the pool. After checkout we stayed at the pool and there were shower facilities here we could use before we left for our flight.,4 out of 5,August 2023,5.0 of 5 stars,#13 of 16 hotels in Sentosa Island,0.19256410256410256,0.6241863905325444,59.628205128205124,62.418639053254445,19.256410256410255,Services
"Shangri-La Rasa Sentosa, Singapore",The Worst Shangri-La Hotel,"This is the worst Shangri-la Hotels I visited so far. I had tried staying a few Shangri-La Hotels in Hong Kong, China, Japan, Bangkok, Tanjung Aru (Sabah), and this Shangri-La Rasa Sentosa is worst among these. The Housekeeping is not up to standard and always had used/dirty towels left in the bathroom (the towels were not used by us. Did not replace used Bathrobe until I asked which was already 3 days later. And some mistakes like, did not refill the empty tissue box. The another problem is the frontdesk, on the day we arrived, we had questions on how our room would be arranged and the manager was extremely rude. The restaurant is also another problem, for the breakfast, only the Indian food is okay, the rest are actually tasted not as good as other Shangri-La Hotels.

We have visited Singapore before but this was our first time with our son. We are so glad we chose Shangri La. We booked for 2 weeks and had 1 week more to travel in Malaysia but we changed plans and stayed a 3rd week here. That’s how amazing it was! We didn’t want to leave. The staff from the moment we checked in until we departed where nothing but fabulous! Nothing was to hard for them. So accommodating. We arrived late at night with a grumpy toddler, they gave him his own bag of beach toys and colouring book and pencils. Fantastic range of food and drinks at breakfast. The F&B team are amazing!!
