That's a 4 star hotel annoyance, usually not at 5 star hotels. Second issue was bell staff letting people out the main door, but then singling us out, telling us we had to go through some side exit. I called him out on it for letting other random people out main exit, and later he approached to explain he let the others out because they were not leaving",3 out of 5,August 2021,5.0 of 5 stars,#42 of 372 hotels in Singapore,0.03765948963317385,0.3151515151515151,51.88297448165869,31.515151515151512,3.7659489633173853,Services

The staff were very attentive and friendly, and continually made efforts to ensure that we were well taken care of.

Shangri-La Singapore,What happened Shangri-La?,"We were looking to have a short family staycation before work commitments takes over. So Shangri-La was it given that our own family member has a work convention in the same hotel. Checking in was a a bad start. Around noon, I drove in at the main lobby and there was no one to receive us. So I parked the car in the lobby so that we can drop our luggage in the room and change and head out again. I unloaded 3 luggage and no one came. Finally a young lad (I believe someone on work internship and/or part time holiday work) came over and asked if I was checking in, I confirmed the same and informed him that I already have a room which was already checked in and will be heading to the reception for the keys left for us and be heading to the room to change quickly.

This is a resort, self sufficient - with enough entertainment and food options so you do not need to leave the compound at all 2. The indoor playground Buds was well maintained and the play area compact and exciting enough for young kids (My 5 year old was extremely happy with it) 3. The water play area Splash was fun with sections for varying ages. 4. The chambermaid was honest. She broke a glass during housekeeping of the room. And she came by to return a new glass.

Hits were the older men in dark suit jackets who appear to be more senior and were jovial, entertaining and fantastic at treating the customers to a luxury experience. Then there were clearly the 'newbies' - one young man admitted it was his 2nd day and that's why he didn't know the answers to any queries - this was fine, we all have to learn but probably not great to have him train at the Valley Wing. However, there appeared to be 'intermediate' staff level who appeared confident but were misinformed and therefore made the experience quite unpleasant. We booked breakfast slot at 10:45 to 12.

The room is furnished with double glazed windows which serve as a very good sound proofing from the road noise and a nearby piling activity.

Shangri-La Singapore,Not for families with younger children,"Children below the age of 4 are only limited to the ball pits at buds. They are unable to go on most of the slides. Did not manage to book splash as there were no slots available. If you plan to book splash i believe you'll need to stay 2 night minimum to secure a slot due to the high demand and low supply. If one were to book 2 nights just for a session at splash it would be better to look at the buds annual membership and gain access to their pool without having to stay in their rooms. Good enough beds but way dated decor. But that is only because i was staying in the garden wing. I believe i would have a better experience if my kids are aged 7 and above.

Shangri-La Singapore,Very Nice,"We very much enjoyed our stay in March 2021. We decided to stay at this hotel after staying at the St. Regis in Singapore because it's one of the few hotels in Singapore that has enough space for a large outdoor pool and large garden/courtyard. So we figured we'd stay at a more City hotel (St. Regis) and then transition to a more resort hotel (even though we were staying in the City still). This was a good plan and we liked both stays at very different hotels that were only 10 minutes apart. Here is the breakdown: Pros: - Excellent pool and outdoor garden/courtyard (this is why we decided to stay here and we were not let down). For a City hotel it had a nice resort feel to it. - I think this is the original Shangri-la hotel, yet, it clearly has been continually updated.

Shangri-La Singapore,Splendid,"My staycation at the Valley Wing Shangri-la was a splendid experience. Stayed at a deluxe room on the top floor of the wing, with great views of Bukit Timah, the Shang gardens and pool below.

Room was spacious, tastefully appointed and functional, except that there were insufficient electrical plugs for ones appliances. The bathroom was equally spacious, despite its age most of the plumbing worked well. A generous platter of fruits was presented, as with a large birthday cake for my guest.

If you are buying a horizon club room you should be aware that the Horizon Club is no longer open. We purchased and paid for this but it is not available. This is disappointing given the cost.

Shangri-La Singapore,Oversubscribed hotel but with exemplary staff,"Our family of 4 arrived around 15 min past the check-in time of 3pm. Queued for about 5 min and was attended to by the front desk staff. During my short time queuing, Diren came forward to check if I was waiting for check-in and his keen eye noticed that my 2 kids were with me, so he proceeded to present them with 2 bags of stuff which will keep them busy during their stay. Appreciate that proactive thoughtfulness. Why I was a little upset was because the room wasn’t ready, and we only finally got the keys to our room at 4pm, which was one hour after the scheduled check-in time, and yet I was denied late check-out as compensation.

Our agent also got in touch but we were not assisted through out our stay. We brought this up to 3 different people and firstly asked them to upgrade or change the room within same hotel to which they said they full and nothing can be done. They refused to also refund us so that we could not find another hotel either. Shame on them. Their reception staff not friendly at all (maybe they need to fire them and bring in staff from countries like Thailand etc who know what customer service is) Their bell boy rude.

The hospitality in Valley Wing was simply awesome. Keith, Benjamin, Celine, Zi Liang and many others whom I don’t remember their name at the Valley lounge was just marvellous. I’ve stayed in many other Marriott (Titanium) and Accor (Diamond) properties in the world and Shangri-la is undisputedly one of the best in the region. I will definitely be back!!

Shangri-La Singapore,Good to be back!,"The moment we arrived at this stunning hotel we were reminded of its tranquility and beauty, the reason we always return here when in Singapore. The Valley Wing stands out for so many reasons, and a stay here leaves you refreshed, relaxed, and wishing you didn’t have to leave. It’s old school style with attention to detail is so very impressive. In particular I’d like to thank Raja, always around to oversee we have everything we need, including never letting our champagne glasses get empty!

Shangri-La Singapore,Resting on Laurels …….I will not be back,I visited around ten years ago and the standards of this fine company have dropped at this location. Having been in the hotel business for over 20 years the British GM has lots of work to do……… Observations on this trip to see the Grand Prix. It seemed to be a surprise to this hotel that the largest event in the City meant it was full! One of the reasons for booking is the regular shuttle to Orchard road for the MRT. However as occupancy has been low they kept the shuttle at only 4 times in the middle of the day. This is critical when competing against all of the many fine Marina Bay properties Worse was to follow at Breakfast in The Line…….Huge full hotel and guess how many on duty at the egg station…..ONE Chef……I discussed this with him and another colleague was away on,3 out of 5,October 2022,5.0 of 5 stars,#42 of 372 hotels in Singapore,0.1813888888888889,0.4584615384615384,59.06944444444444,45.84615384615384,18.13888888888889,Services
Shangri-La Singapore,Excellent Property and Hospitality,"I stayed at Shangri-La mid November. There was a business event at the same place so it was a convenient choice.

When I stayed a number of the hotel restaurants were closed (the Japanese on the 24th floor for example), with no explanation or sense they would be reopening again soon. Room was comfortable although an unstocked mini bar was a little strange. The gym is open 24/7 although the equipment was a little dated. The outdoor pool was amazing - a highlight!

Shangri-La Singapore,Exceptional,"The shangri-la Singapore is a wonderful hotel with something for everyone. We could have easily spent a week in Singapore without leaving this hotel. The huge pool with sun lounges all around, the Splash pool for the children with waterslides and fountains, tennis courts, an on site bakery with beautiful coffee, plenty of space both under cover outside and inside the hotel in beautiful surroundings for that morning or afternoon or evening coffee or tea or something stronger. The turtle family to check on every day. The oh so comfy beds and the happy faces of all the staff. It's at the upper level of pricing but not by much, and so worth it.

But somehow when I made a fuss, they could magically conjure up a table and when we went for dinner, the restaurant was quite! The Waterfall restaurant is fantastic, but the Line a la carte is awful (their breakfast buffet is good). A heads up that it gets busy on weekends would’ve helped instead of all the emails offering upgrades ahead of the stay. The pool and the kids areas were great.

The pool loungers do get busy but the pool never felt overly crowded. I think the garden rooms are looking a bit tired but still beautiful. The pool view balcony was perfect for us and the hotel lovely and quiet at night. The breakfast is sensational and a highlight for my kids. My daughter really enjoyed splash. It’s the little things like the way the housekeeping arranged my daughters toys in the bed that make you realise what a special hotel it is.

I asked the gentleman at the counter whether these were noted on our booking and he said they were but the hotel was full. Judging by the numbers at breakfast and in other areas of the hotel this was not the case at all. Food was OK but extremely overpriced.

Shangri-La Singapore,Sumptuous,"Stayed several nights in January. Huge hotel with 3 main wings: we were in the Valley Wing, which has its own entrance /reception / breakfast area / terrace. The breakfasts there were excellent: a small room (the Summit) and a terrace outside. Recommend the Roti Prati. The staff attention and detail was super. Friendly, personal and know your name. Being in the Valley wing was good, as the main hotel reception is enormous - though immaculate and sumptuous - and the reception there we felt was a little too small/required a queue when we went; so the Valley concierge/reception was just right. Additionally Valley guests are provided with complimentary afternoon tea, (delightful particularly with a harpist plucking-away in the background) and I think, evening Cockails and canapes",5 out of 5,February 2023,5.0 of 5 stars,#42 of 372 hotels in Singapore,0.2809193121693122,0.5473544973544974,64.04596560846561,54.735449735449734,28.091931216931222,General

Shangri-La Singapore,Short stay in Singapore,Efficient service and well run operation. Despite the hotel being an older one as have stayed almost 15 years ago it is well maintained. Quite a pleasant short stay and the only small concern was we missed the cutoff for the breakfast at 10:32 and they were inflexible and said we could not have the breakfast that was to be included. Two minutes...All i wanted was a coffee and some bread.....it wasn't that big of a deal as we were on a complimentary voucher which we paid for at a Charity Silent Auction Event.

There were people just stacking their plates and tables full of food, then leaving it, it was such a waste and resulted in shortages for everyone else. By 09:30 breakfast wasn’t being replenished and therefore we were left with cold leftovers that were left in the serving bowls. The pool was nice, especially the guys with the towels and those serving the drinks, however, again a few people spoiled things, the jacuzzi said no children, however, it was full of children whilst parents just left them to splash everyone.

Shangri-La Singapore,A holiday well spent,"I had the privilege to stay at the Shangri La Singapore’s Valley Wing during my last visit to Singapore. The experience was second to none. From the moment you enter the hotel through dedicated a VIP-style entrance, you are greeted by an outstanding team of butlers escorting you to the reception. What makes the Valley Wing outstanding is the level of personalisation it offers to customers.

Shangri-La Singapore,Disappointing effort,"Pre pandemic I have been a regular user of Shangri-La hotels. As usual I stayed in a Horizon Club room. Was it me but I felt the helpful, friendly, welcoming atmosphere has disappeared. No restaurant open after 9.00pm, staff looking at watches when you arrive close to last order time. Not everyone wants to have room service at that time. Staff refusing to refer requests to speak to the duty manager and then referring an account enquiry to Head Office.

Staying at the Valley Wing for 25 years, it is remarkable to see that many members of the staff are still there. Yet, this time, all the good things - for which I pay a considerable premium vs other five-star-hotels in Singapore - are being overshadowed by something that I was confronted with already last time, but this time again. Upon checking in, the hotel wants your credit card. Now I am a European citizen but do have local cards for various countries, so I said that I wanted to use my Singaporean DEBIT card for payment.

Overall we enjoyed our stay, it was comfortable, the staff were good (especially bell boys and concierge), we absolutely loved Singapore and crammed lots into our short visit.. I have to say though, this isn't a 5 star hotel and probably needs to be regraded to 3 or 4 star until it's undergone refurbishment. Initial impressions and the lobby/reception area were lovely, but our room (deluxe king in the tower block) was very dated and in need of a refurb, with a view out over a scruffy rooftop.

The greenery and nature garden surroundings really have the hotel a 5* feel.

The staff were very friendly and really went out of their way especially for the children.

I was pleased to say that I really enjoyed my time here in Singapore. We prefer the Horizon Club rooms with access to the lounge. It is always a great space for guests and the Singapore lounge is on the highest floor of the property. My one negative for Singapore was the shuttle bus times and service. It ran mid morning to mid afternoon so not particularly convenient or useful. Public transport can be reached on foot. This is a large property and worth exploring when there.

Shangri-La Singapore,Mixed Bag,"Stayed here for a week in the Garden Wing. The room was large and well furnished. Strangely, though, there is no proper fridge, just a compressor-less chiller that does very little to keep things cool. On the other hand, the air con was not only noisy, it chilled well below the set temperature. Even setting the thermostat to 28 degrees resulted in a freezing room temperature. A mechanic made some adjustments, basically no effect. Beds were noisy when one turned over, which was apparently due to a lack of caster cups under the beds (so their rubber wheels moved and made noise). A boxspring was broken. And a curtain motor switch did not work. These things were all addressed, but they should not have been there to begin with.

Unfortunately this meant that the family ‘packages’ and the additional amenities for families in the Tower Wing were not available to us so we were washing up bottles in the bathroom sink etc. The room we had was spacious but did have a balcony so from a safety perspective we chose to always keep the door closed. The bath was great with a toddler - very generous! Our toddler has a number of allergies which posed a problem at breakfast.

Shangri-La Singapore,Beautiful garden hotel in Singapore,"This is a great hotel in Singapore. The room was very nice, and the service is incredible throughout the hotel. The grounds of the hotel are like a botanical garden, and the pool is a real treat. The breakfast brunch is very nice (almost a bit overwhelming in terms of the variety that is available!). The lobby has a great expansive feel to it. In terms of drawbacks, there are two to consider. One, it is definitely a hotel that caters to families with younger children. I think it is great, but I understand some people may prefer a quieter place. Second, it is not so easy to walk from the hotel to say Orchard Street. The streets just around the hotel are not so pedestrian friendly, so most people take cabs to get in and out of the hotel.

Shangri-La Singapore,An excellent stay. Great proactive Service Recovery at Checkin,"Spent 1 night in the Garden Wing on a staycation over the May Day long weekend. Guests at the Garden Wing checkin with the guests from the Tower Wing. This resulted in a chaotic main lobby Because it was also a public holiday weekend. People were trying to check out, others trying to checkin and many others waiting for their rooms to be ready. As expected, our room wasn't ready even though we arrived closer to 4pm. But kudos to the hotel, they GROs did a great job by patiently explaining the situation and spreading us around the lobby area so there was no scrum at the counter. The hotel gave us a day pass to enjoy the pool while waiting for the room to be ready.

Stunning pool area, big rooms with fantastic facilities. Great gym with lots of equipment and Amazing shower and change facilities. Food and beverage is fantastic from cafe to restaurant. Loved the breakfast. One thing we lived is that if anyone puts out their towel and disappears, staff will remove the towels so you don’t find yourself coming to the pool and not finding a sun lounge. The gardens around the pool and hotel are beautiful. Special thanks to Sunny who cleaned our room everyday, left little goodies for the kids and was just so friendly. Sad to leave that’s for sure.

Shangri-La Singapore,Shangri-la’s Hidden Gem ~ The Valley Wing,"I took the Romantic Indulgence to celebrate the anniversary. The manager, Amin, handled my check-in seamlessly although the room wasn’t ready when I arrived. He is very friendly, warm, hospitable and helpful. While waiting for our room, being the guests at Valley Wing, we were invited to help ourselves to the afternoon high tea which came with cocktail or the usual coffee/tea selection. Food served here at The Summit was delectable. There is a certain class of luxury and comfort when staying in the Valley Wing. Firstly, it is located at another side with its own reception, restaurant, driveway, lobby and team of service staff. It is peaceful and quiet unlike the noisier main tower. The rooms and furnishing has a very upper English class feel .

Shangri-La Singapore,Resort Style Hotel With a Factory Feel,"I was attracted by the thought of a green hotel in a garden city. Realistically, bubbling waterfalls, big swimming pools, well kept lawns and a few tennis courts did seem to offer some respite from the hot sticky and busy world outside the hotel gates. We stayed in the Garden wing. We had a beautifully clean room with hardwood floors, opening onto a balcony edged with a sea of bright red flowers. The beds were firm and comfortable. The pillows (so often a weak spot in luxury hotels) were just right. I can recommend the spa. I had a Thai massage and my daughter had a facial. Ultra relaxing and the spa had a serene and calming atmosphere with very skilled staff. Breakfast was included and was awesome in it's variety, quality and quantity.

Shangri-La Singapore,Disappointed,Have stayed at the Shangri La on a number of times and rated it 5 stars and our special place in Singapore. But that was then this is now. The Hotel Foyer has been revamped and as a consequence the hotel has lost its allure. It has a cold impersonal air about it. The staff that were once friendly now seem distant. The Italian Restaurant which we looked forwarded to so much was a flop. Sea Food Marinara was luke warm and noticeable for its lack of sea food. The pasta was undercooked as well which made it difficult to chew. Breakfast was served in the Line and that's what it was. We formed a line and when a table became vacant the race was on to get it. We took turns in guarding our possession and getting our food in competition with quite a large number of fellow guests.,3 out of 5,August 2019,5.0 of 5 stars,#42 of 372 hotels in Singapore,0.06071428571428572,0.5166666666666667,53.035714285714285,51.66666666666667,6.071428571428572,General

The genuine, helpful, warm, friendly but professional but service is what you can and will receive. Shangri-La is my home.

Travelling with a baby just became stress free!! 🍼 the family floor even featured these cute little sculptures of animals which Ezra loved every time he got off the lift and free apples in a brown which he ate every day! 🍼 our bedroom had a toddler bed in the window inside a tipee tent.

The hotel lobby is subtle but still stunning - particularly the garden wall above the lobby bar. The rooms are of course spacious and well appointed. Buffet is as you would expect dependably good food. I ate at Origin Grill and Waterfall restaurant and my meals were excellent (in particular the profiteroles at Waterfall!).

Shangri-La Singapore,Great Place to Stay,"After several years of not having stayed in Shangri-la Singapore, it is nice to be back in that hotel thanks to the organizers of the event I participated. I used to stay in the hotel almost every year some years back. And it is delightful to see that the services have remained as friendly and efficient as ever. I noticed though that the food selection during breakfast has decreased. The airconditioning throughout the hotel, whether in the Valley Wing or main tower is also just too cold for comfort. Perhaps, they should consider putting the thermostat a bit. Not only will that save on energy, it will also make guests more confortable. Likewise, it would be helpful if they make the food bar at the Horizon Club Lounge close a little bit later, say 9 or even 10PM.

Shangri-La Singapore,Terrific concierge desk,The concierge and front desk staff made the difference for us on this stay they were excellent. Johnny in particular was a true professional. We asked about last minute tickets the morning of Christmas Day to the Gardens by the Bay winter wonderland and other events. Johnny would not rest until he found us tickets for everything and even found discounted prices. He did so with a genuine cheerfulness and a high degree of skill. He really made a favorable impression. We stayed as a family of five in two Garden Wing Deluxe rooms. One room had a king and the other had two queen beds. We added a rollaway bed as well which we found to be quite comfortable. Here are some of the pros and cons. First the pros: - The rooms in the Garden wing feel modern and clean. - The bathroom,4 out of 5,December 2019,5.0 of 5 stars,#42 of 372 hotels in Singapore,0.2628888888888889,0.47822222222222227,63.144444444444446,47.82222222222223,26.288888888888888,Services

Worse, I had explained about my tight schedule that afternoon and asked for a rough estimation so that I could have a headway but only to be told they do not know in return. Without an estimation of how long the wait would be, I was left helpless as to know what to do next and could not go about the rest of the day’s program.

We paid for access to the horizon club..certain parts of the horizon club have very noticeable sewage smell every day we have visited so far...it’s terrible. 2. Disappointing that multiple items on the pool menu aren’t available: today for example, both Rose wine options weren’t available and none of the four smoothies on menu were available.

Shangri-La Singapore,Forest paradise in the middle of the city,The breakfast buffet was the largest we've ever seen.  It's just not huge but very well chosen articles and the quality was excellent. Only complaint about the breakfast is the coffee service.  You can make much better coffee by yourself using Nespresso machines which are available there. Room and bathroom very nicely renovated. Only complain in that sector comes from the age of the hotel. Almost 50 years ago room height was lower and there is not enough natural light in the room.  One thing I suggest is please remove those large writing desks which are totally blocking the windows and takes the last spacious feeling away. The incoming experience was one the best.

The hotel was somewhat dated, however we did check in their Tower Wing, which was recently renovated. Even then, the rooms were not luxurious as I would expect from the Shangri La hotel chain and for some inexplicable reasons, the placement of the king bed was at a 45 degree angle, which made the room very odd indeed. The hotel was not child friendly at all - the playroom was on a paid to use basis, something like Singapore $70 for a 3 hour use and only admit one accompanying adult. The Horizon Club (more about that later) was not opened to children between 5-8pm and when they were allowed to enter, they were confined to a",2 out of 5,February 2020,5.0 of 5 stars,#42 of 372 hotels in Singapore,-0.004166666666666663,0.42749999999999994,49.791666666666664,42.74999999999999,0.4166666666666663,General

Shangri-La Singapore,Staycation at Valley Wing,"Not able to travel due to COVID-19 outbreak worldwide, I'm happy that Shangri-la Singapore has offered some staycation packages and we have delightfully opted to indulge ourselves with a weekend stay in the Valley Wing. Not sure whether it's because we are locals staying in a local hotel or now it's during COVID-19 period and services have to be somewhat compromised, the level of service falls short of my expectation in few areas. Guests recognition is lacking as compared to my stay at Horizon Club Floor at many other Shangri-la properties. It makes my even more appreciative of many overseas staff who were able to remember the guests' names. We had breakfast at The Summit Room which is exclusive and happy with the ala carte menu.

Shangri-La Singapore,Staycation,"While I have been to this hotel for a number of times, this visit was my first staycation here. We were here primarily for the Buds and Splashzone. Else we are more likely found in the main Orchard road hotels for a shopping staycation or Sofitel Sentosa for a relaxing stay. One day prior to the check-in, I received an online check-in notification through their app and what surprised me was the incidental deposit the hotel has requested. For a 2 nites stay, I was asked to put up a $1.5+k deposit for incidental charges and this amount also included the room rate. Issue here is that I have already fully paid for the room rate a few months back and thus, why are they charging me for the room rate again?

Shangri-La Singapore,Disappointing Stay at the Garden Wing,"I have had 4 staycations at different five-star hotels recently and this was the most disappointing out of the lot. Stayed for a night on a Sunday. We only managed to check in past 4pm as our room wasn't ready - we were given two coupons for complimentary welcome drinks while waiting, and the reception was extremely polite, so that was fine. We were initially allocated a room on the 4th floor with a pool view (which I would recommend that you avoid; the lobby is on the 3rd floor), but to our horror, there was a trail of ants on the table after we came back from dinner (I have photos and a video) - we didn't eat in the room and had only made coffee.

In response to my review, the General Manager hoped to welcome us back for a renewed experience again at the hotel. Well, we were back again, to spend our New Year at Valley Wing. The very moment I stepped out of the car at Valley Wing entrance, I could sense the difference. I was readily greeted by friendly and helpful doorman Ryan who immediately came forward to help me with my bag and opened the entrance door for me. He also offered to keep our bags to be sent up to our room later (yes, our bags were already in our room when we went up an hour later).

It was hard as a rock and the pillows, while they looked super fluffy, were almost flat upon lying your head on them. The sleep quality could have been better.

Only got our key to the room at around 4.15pm. Unable to give us a late check out to compensate for the delaycheck in. In my view, this is not the service one expects from a brand like the shangrila. Room was a bit dated but that’s OK as room was reasonably clean. However the kettle in the room did not switch off by itself.

I wanted to compliment both the hotel and the staff for the outstanding hospitality and warmth shown throughout our stay. In our interactions with lobby/lounge ambassadors and the dining staff, it was evident how the hotel goes to the length to ensure the safety and welfare of the staff. It had certainly contributed to the motivation and dedication of the staff. They feel appreciated and as such they provide the best in class service to us in turn.

Shangri-La Singapore,Good experience,"I stayed here last Dec, and decided to return again this week for the same valley Indulgence package. It was overall a pleasant experience, though we noted a few changes. In the valley wing club room, they no longer had a buffet line, but rather a designated tea & canapes set. It was definitely much safer by hygiene standards, though the service was slower. Also, they have implemented a booking for usage of the pool which is better to ensure that the number of pax is manageable, though this meant that you may not necc be able to get the pool at your preferred time. overall I enjoyed the experience and especially the massage! :)",4 out of 5,March 2021,5.0 of 5 stars,#42 of 372 hotels in Singapore,0.22777777777777777,0.44027777777777777,61.38888888888889,44.02777777777778,22.77777777777778,Amenities

February stay: After a superb stay experience over the New Year weekends, we immediately booked another stay in end February under Valley Wing Indulgence package.

During evening cocktails, it took quite a long while for everything to be served. Our glasses were empty for a good 30 mins but staffs were too busy to notice and it was difficult to get their attention too.
