M Social Singapore,Very Tiny Rooms,"Check-in was a hassle as there was someone at the door completing the health status questionnaire and reviewing your reservation, before you head to the front desk at the lobby to complete the check-in. There was quite a queue due to these double layer of checks. Booked the Alcove Terrace Room which seems to be good for one person. There is hardly enough space to move about the room. The room is basic with the wash basin incorporated into the room, while the bathroom has a WC and shower stall.

M Social Singapore,Enjoyed our stay!,"It was a pleasant stay at M Social Hotel. The location was relatively quiet as it was not facing any major roads and the at the back of the hotel is the nice and calm Singapore river. There are a lot of food and cafe options just beside the hotel and it is located in the middle of very popular dining spots visited by expats and locals alike. The check-in and out was very smooth. Although the Alcove Cosy room wasn't the biggest, it was very quiet (with good noise cancellation from the walls) and very comfy. The design of the room and lighting was also very modern, clean-cut and soothing.

M Social Singapore,HOURS of waiting for check-in,"Partner and I completed the online contactless check-in before arrival at 2:45pm. We were told that we still had to join the long queue (queue went out of the hotel's entrance) to get our cards verified before getting the keys. This renders the contactless check-in pretty redundant in our opinion. We decided to take a walk and come back later when the queue will perhapse be shorter. We were met with an even longer queue upon returning at 4:45pm. Joint the queue and only got to the room at 6:30pm. There wasn't any room with twin bed ready (which was what we booked), so we had to settle with the room with 2 single beds. Room was small but everything else was alright.

So we called in the morning of check-in to check and they told us all slots are fully booked and gave us a slot AFTER my checkout (ridiculous).

M Social Singapore,Do seriously consider buying door chokes for your cleaners,"The cleaners leave the front door lock engaged but the door not fully closed so that they can push/pull open the door without needing to turn the door handle. The doors have a door close mechanism on them, so every time the door is opened, the door would automatically slam shut but with the lock engaged, it would slam on the door frame with a loud bang every time. Seems like the cleaners need to get in/out of a room at times every 15-30 seconds while they are cleaning it. So for the entire duration (about 10-15 minutes), you will hear bang, bang, banging of the door. It is loud and I can assure you that even if it is happening on the floor above or below you will hear it very well from your room.

The gym and pool on Level 5 is accessible via the hotel card. However due to social distancing, usage of swimming pool has to be pre-booked. Suggest for hotel to have greater clarity/less gaps in terms of communications (i.e. confirmed time and place meetup before courses starts) for a better guest experience. Pros: 1.

We had both been really busy at work and were looking forward to an evening off. On arrival we were downgraded to a room that was tiny and told that to make it up for it, they would give us a voucher worth SGD 10 more than the difference in price for the room! Oh and the best part - the dining voucher has to be used during the stay even though we had plans to eat elsewhere that evening. So basically even though we paid for a big room- they would put us in a small room and expect us to eat in their restaurant to get our money back.No explanation other than they just didn't have time to call us and tell us the room we booked wasn't available (even a 10 minute heads up would",1 out of 5,February 2022,4.0 of 5 stars,#83 of 373 hotels in Singapore,0.2227272727272727,0.3795454545454545,61.13636363636363,37.95454545454545,22.27272727272727,Value

I phoned about an advertised upgrade deal in advance to be told there were plenty of rooms and to enquire on arrival. There were no rooms when I arrived early in the morning after a long flight which was irritating- I was moved later that day but in the meantime the shower was broken. The air conditioning packed up - I assumed I was using it incorrectly but the maintenance man said he could see it was faulty on their system - not sure why they don’t check it routinely. Had to move again. The room amenities incl towels were not topped up daily - once I had no hand towels or bath mat at all. Had to search for a cleaner to get supplies.

M Social Singapore,"*Very Poor Service
*Very Small Room
*Poor Internet Service.
*cleaners/room service is Poor","We booked from 30/4/2022 to 2/5/2022. Not a good place for staycation. Room is very small. Internet service is not good. Even if you are already connected but signal keep switching off and cannot reconnect. Until we call again the counter for IT help, that IT personnel told me that they need to accept my unit before i can use the internet even if i already connect to hotel wifi. Poor Room Service / cleaners: the cleaners will not clean the room untill we already called them to clean at 5:30pm already, so they never cleab our room the whole day and not replace the towels and bedsheets. After the cleaners came to change our bedsheets and towels, we still noticed that tissue, body wash/shampoo/comditioners was not changed to new one and atill need to tell them.

M Social Singapore,Highly recommended not to stay,"No matter who pays, is it by yourself or your company. But staying has to be money worthy. I think M Social has disappointed by far considering everything of this hotel. I just cannot find a single good thing to write about. Let me give some bad sides of this hotel: Front Desk: They are always extreme busy always. I think they just memorized the steps and deliver accordingly. They have to be a lot more slow while dealing with customer. They are always in hurry seems like they have to catch a train. Room quality: Tremendously bad. Not money worth it all. Breakfast: I was quite surprised that till some hotels are available who don't give buffet breakfast. Here you have to order your breakfast and wait for 15 mins.

M Social Singapore,"Great location, ordinary breakfast","We stayed at M Social for nearly a month. Biggest pro was the location, right on Robertson Quay. Biggest con was breakfast. Beast and Butterflies is the restaurant connected to the hotel and where breakfast is served. The food overall there is excellent - the cous cous salad and grilled salmon were standouts. But the breakfast was appalling. Three a la carte options only, no buffet. Imagine a white toast, wilted salad, lukewarm hash browns affair. There were no real healthy options either which, day after day, made for monotonous and unappetizing eating. We abandoned breakfast there after day four. The rooms were quite good, compact but design inspired eg cathedral ceilings, little courtyard off your room.

The only con was the red light coming from the TV which was very obvious at night and took a bit of getting used to but not really much of an issue. Overall we enjoyed our time!

Our room layout was that we had the bed downstairs and the couch and television on the loft space so the gap between the steps leading up to the stairs and the bed was very narrow, my pinky toe hit side of it couple of times and it swelled for a while so that was uncomfortable.

The room is not that clean as you can found hair on the wash basin and floor, bed is ok. The light is not enough in the room which even not able to have proper make up. Make up room service is very slow as I heard they lack of manpower which make it delays to 5pm still not yet make it. The house keeper even forget to refill your shower gel.

The staff were lovely and I got a late check out free to 2pm. The reason I gave 3 stars is because there were 2 things I wasn't happy with so I deducted a star for each. The room was tiny. More like a pod. I'd booked a double room and got the old twin beds pushed together job. This annoys me intensely. The sink was in the bedroom and it was just so so small. I had stayed in another hotel the weekend before and I could have fitted my pod here 3 times into the other hotels room.

The M is well located at Robertson Quay, with many cafes, restaurants and bars located within easy walking distance along the river.

We never waited more than 5 minutes for a train, everything is clean and so efficient. We bought an MRT pass at the airport and loaded $50 onto it. In our four days we would have caught 20-30 trains, and at the end we still had $35 left on our passes, which was refunded at the airport on the way out of Singapore.

On the next day, when I came back to pick up my luggage that I had left, the staff asked me to go into the storage room and find my own bag! Second, the bathroom was extremely dirty.

During check-in, the staff attending to me asked whether I’d be alone, and once I replied in the affirmative, he immediately arranged for a Queen bed. What I really liked about my stay: • The entire hotel had a “chillax” ambience. The lobby décor is arty and with avant- garde vibes. Club music also plays at the lobby and the vehicle drop-off point. It’s cool to just chill in the lobby during the later part of the evening. • My alcove room was somewhat small as far as floor space is concerned.

The rooms seem small (the alcove room definitely is), with barely any space to walk.

There was also no shampoo in my room, but there were two tubes of body wash - maybe that was a mistake. And the booking system is upfront about extras that you have to pay for (e.g. birthday decor), giving you a budget airline feel. Check in and check out can be slow.

I particularly loved the small cupcake shop near the Hotel. Proximity to CBD, little India, China town is a big plus along with superb Wifi speed and an additional handset they give in case you need to navigate around the town. There are few downsides as well, it isn't close to any hawker center (in case you want to walk down and enjoy fresh satay's, in morning rush hours it takes 10+ minutes to reach CBD, room felt a tad too small although they showed me loft as well but that too wasn't too spacious for the price (I assume I am spoiled by swanky and spacious rooms we have in India).",5 out of 5,June 2019,4.0 of 5 stars,#83 of 373 hotels in Singapore,0.2332516339869281,0.44885620915032676,61.66258169934641,44.885620915032675,23.325163398692812,Location

The terrace is fine but other people hang their washing on the trees on theirs... unattractive and it overlooks a driveway .

The reception went out of their way to help us with any request or question we had; especially the two male staff members that we encountered (sadly we didn’t catch their names). We arrived at 6am and they were more than happy to hold our bags and let us use the hotel facilities, as well as letting us into our room early. The breakfast had a good range. The room was small, but we managed perfectly fine and when everything is to such a high standard it’s not much of a problem at all. We both had big suitcases after 6 weeks of travel but with some manouvering it was fine.

First, the reception made me feel like I was checking in to a budget hotel, the self check-in is not for use (i was directed to wait to be checked-in by a physical person instead), no welcome and although I have listed that it was a stay to celebrate an anniversary, nothing was done to make our stay any special which just reinforced the feeling which I felt like I was staying in a budget hotel.

M Social Singapore,Excellent Hotel and great location,"This hotel is wonderful! The staff are helpful and friendly. The hotel itself is beautifully decorated by Philippe Starck so it’s a nice atmosphere and difference than a “typical” hotel. We upgraded to a loft room, which, if it is in your budget I would definitely recommend. There is an efficient use of space as in the room, making it seem much bigger than it is. The hotel itself is right on the river with resturants and nightlife on one side, and close to Robertson Walk, which has resturants.

M Social Singapore,Rooms are quite small but comfortable,"We booked a room over the weekend for a short staycation and to celebrate a birthday. Picked the Terrace Room which is on the second floor because of its outdoor garden/balcony. Room is a little smaller than what I imagined. The sink is just opposite your bed instead of being in the toilet and there isn't a lot of space to move around. The room is still comfortable though, just that the lack of space is quite jarring for the price range. Location wise the hotel is not bad, located right next to the Singapore River, which you can take a scenic stroll along to reach places like Clarke Quay and Esplanade. There are also many eateries nearby, though more on the pricey end. Staff are also quite friendly during the check in and out process.

I was not able to get a higher floor room but it’s alright I understand occupancy might not have allowed it. We came in and they had pre-decorated our bed with the swan towel and fake flower petals which I thought was a really sweet and thoughtful gesture as using fake flower petals would first up help people with pollen allergies still have the nice surprise and also it’s reusable (I would think).

M Social Singapore,Would recommend to family and friends,"Stayed here for 5 nights with my sister during our first time travelling to Singapore. We picked this hotel because of the good central location, 10 minute walk from the bus stops to get around Singapore's tourist attractions (Orchard Road, National Museum, Haji Lane, Arab Street, Chinatown). 10-20 minutes on the bus to get to those places. You are able to catch a glimpse of Marina Bay Sands from certain angles while walking along the Singapore River. We had Gretchen look after us during our stay. Knowing it was our first time in Singapore and because we got lucky that there was room availability, she upgraded our room to the Loft Premier Room. She was so friendly and accommodating.

This is a basic and nice hotel, if you have lots of luggage it won’t be suitable. The reason they get such a low rating is due to extreme circumstances.

The furniture is in good condition. Some interesting thing is that they offer robot service which is pretty refreshing. (This means you don't need to pay tips). However, the only thing to pin point is really the breakfast selection. It is not tasty at all. There is an egg machine which kinda makes up for the lack. Otherwise, this can be improved!

Staff Nuri informed us that she has added on the breakfast for us and we could proceed directly to the restaurant the next day. However when we went down the next day, we were turned down by the staff as he said that our breakfast was only for 1. He told us to make additional payment on the spot.

I’ve been waiting i the queue for at least 30 minutes. While waiting i have nothing to do other than observing what the staff are doing.

At $320, it is the most expensive room in the designer hotel. I did my homework, I did my research. This is it. It’s got the killer looks. I booked it through the Millennium hotel site as it promised a host of parity benefits such as 10% discount and check in anytime. Plus 24-hour occupancy as a Millennium member.

M Social Singapore,2D1N Weekend Staycation,"Would like to commend the manager in charge, Geraldine, for her good customer service and hospitality. She attended to us very well. Room is pretty cosy and decent. Location is fairly convenient. Unfortunately, the only problem we faced was that the hotel per se does not have any complimentary parking spaces for us guests when we arrived. Yet when I booked on their millennium website directly, it did state that there was a free parking space. However, Manager explained apologetically to us that it was because we did not book online through M Social instead but millennium(which would have stated it does not have foc parking).

M Social Singapore,Weekend staycay back at Msocial,"Just ended our staycation at Msocial today. It was a home away from home for the two of us! We stayed on Sunday-Monday to celebrate my birthday. When checking in, there was a long queue and I realised that it was the same when I checked out too and the other guests were checking in. Maybe what the hotel could do is to open up more counters / install self check in kiosks to facilitate the overwhelming queue in the future and that the workload of the front desk personnel could be minimalised. :) Our initial booking was for the loft room but due to technical difficulties on the air conditioner my partner was given the information an hour prior to check in.

M Social Singapore,Wedding anniversary,We went for the staycation due to Covid period. Very pretty place. We spend around $230 for a loft terrace room. Check in queue was long but very fast. The staff made sure that we are all safe to enter. The hotel was near to great world city. We just have to walk around 15 min to reach there. The inside of the room was really nice but pretty small. My room came with a tree resting place which was located outside. The bed is located on top of the loft. So no disturbance from tv. Just sleep. We had dinner at Beast & Butterflies. Which is the best for the day. But it is a bit pricy. We took a stroll after our dinner and end up in Great World City to get the awfully chocolate. The stroll was filled with people. And a lot of dog lovers. We enjoy the after meal breeze walking.

The room is small so prepare yourself to have your toes get hurt hitting the sharp legs of the bed every now and then!

Because of the recent govt initiative that provided locals voucher incentives to explore Singapore attractions, including hotels, the long waiting time made news. During the pre-registration check-in given via email, I selected the 11am-12pm registration slot. Arrived at around 11am at the registration table at the entrance & given a ticket & was allowed to store our baggage. We were pleasantly surprised to be given a call at 12.30pm that a room was ready. Returned at 2.30pm to discover a 7m line of people waiting. But with the ticket, we",1 out of 5,December 2020,4.0 of 5 stars,#83 of 373 hotels in Singapore,0.04722222222222222,0.3527777777777778,52.361111111111114,35.27777777777778,4.722222222222222,Services
M Social Singapore,"Very good hardware, but frontdesk service has room for improvement.","Stayed at this hotel for 2nights staycation. Plus Points first: Very good hardware used in the hotel, good furnishings, from bed to shower. Very good. Special shoutout to Housekeeping staff: Mr Ken Rock for being so friendly and helpful despite his busy schedule to make up the rooms for the next batch of guests. Now the bad points, bear with me: Frontdesk staff is cold and lack basic customer service skills. The choice of words and the way you say it makes a lot of difference. E.g. It was drizzling and we need to borrow umbrella, we approach the frontdesk, she said can take it ""over there"", pointing to the entrance, could have walked us there or smile and say it. When we approached the umbrella rack to borrow, we told bluntly : one room, one umbrella.

Can park in the car park and I feel unlikely to get stolen but just lock it up as no where to tether it to. Recommend to book the pool, it's quite a nice one. Gym is good too. The room is very nice and comfortable and personally I like the in-room sink, saves space and also convenient.

M Social Singapore,Lovely loft design but poor service,Unique room design that’s lovely for a change as we upgrade to premiere loft. Service was below expectations. Even we took the initiative to smile it was ignored. The loft room is nice even though is small. Definitely well design. If you love style and design it’s good for a stay. However the Aircon was not cool. We could not have a good night sleep as we are really sweating. We ask for extra tea bags at night and it was deliver to us within mins by Noveiia. She was the only smiling staff that I met during this whole staycation. The highlight was the perfume workshop. It was conducted by Noveiia. It was done professionally and making us feel comfortable. We will highly recommend this workshop.

M Social Singapore,Cleaning process is not known,"The hotel does not tell us about what their housekeeping processes are like...not even a brief description of the steps they take to ensure that our rooms are clean. So, I don't know if the service I received was up to their standard as I am not aware of them and makes the hotel seem less transparent with us. Would appreciate a housekeeping card in the future.",2 out of 5,August 2021,4.0 of 5 stars,#83 of 373 hotels in Singapore,0.012500000000000006,0.24583333333333335,50.625,24.583333333333336,1.2500000000000007,Services
M Social Singapore,Cozy and well-appointed!,"Had a great couple of days' stay at M Social! Although the Alcove Room was small as expected, I found it rather well-appointed, probably only missing a bidet (still more convenient even though the WC was just next to the shower) and perhaps a floor lamp at the far end of the room to boost and balance out the lighting. Amenities wise, I loved both the pool and gym. The pool was long and very swimmable, I was able to do proper laps. The gym while not huge, had the right equipment which also looked relatively new; music was cute. Perhaps a nitpick would be a little more upkeep of the pool area. Throughout my stay, the loungers and umbrellas seemed to be just left to the elements, 1 or 2 umbrellas looked a little precarious. Front desk could be a tad warmer and friendlier but I",4 out of 5,August 2021,4.0 of 5 stars,#83 of 373 hotels in Singapore,0.16472802559759084,0.5079098437794091,58.236401279879544,50.79098437794091,16.472802559759085,Amenities
