# Introduction 
The hospitality industry plays a big part in the economy, catering to diverse groups of people with different expectations and preferences. Thus, the team seeks to address the big questions asked by hotels as well as the guests. The team believes that by combining analytics and predictive modelling with large scale data sources, the team can offer data-driven solutions that will serve both hoteliers and guests. 

The main purpose of this study is to identify the pros and cons of the hotel by utilising data-driven insights. In doing so, the team aims to tackle two big issues. 
1.Maximise Hotel Occupancy: What areas can the hotels improve on to achieve a balance between maximising revenue and satisfying guests? 
2.Personalised Recommendations: How can we help the consumers to better select the hotel that best suits their individual needs and preferences.
