We went in and didn't even get greeted, everything fine because will ruin our vacation, but they still somehow managed to.. The people there where rude and hated their jobs clearly.. First night I had a cramp in my shoulders because the pillows were hard like bricks and the room was freezing cold. The view was a window facing a wall and that in both rooms we had. Breakfast was a real shock.. we had to wait in a line for about 20minutes just to get frozen ham and dry pancakes.. The people their didnâ€™t care if anything was empty, for example we never got milk (to the point where the neighbors table borrowed us the milk they bought at the store the day before :@ It's just really disappointing and nothing there went anywhere
Service was amazing, the staff are so helpful and kind.
The process of both check-in and check-out were smooth.
Received an upgrade to a Straits Club room instead of the normal room that we got, the Straits Club benefits were amazing, though the room was slightly dated, but the perks surely made up for it. Thanks Malo at the reception for helping me with the upgrade, would definitely recommend a stay there
This has to be one of the best hotels I have ever stayed at in my life. Big compliment ...but I do not exaggerate. Let me explain-- yes the hotel is old-style gorgeous with a red carpet, incredibly beautiful lobby, doorman, luxurious rooms, a breakfast that was out of this world and literally had dishes from every part of the world... but what made it incredible was the unbelievable attention to detail ... from the moment you enter, until the moment you leave. The afternoon tea was a delight... Christine would make sure we would access to everything, provided information on local areas to get souvenirs/food, brought us umbrellas as she noticed it was raining as we headed outside, provided hand held battery operated fans on a hot and humid day, we said we liked the snacks
Warning...booking a staycation at The Fullerton to celebrate your anniversary might make your other half look bad! The team really went out of their way to make sure we were well taken care of right at the start when we checked in. From Shermaine at Front Desk, to Nicholas and his team at Straits Lounge, to even our entertaining guide who charmed my in-laws during The Heritage Tour we prebooked! It certainly won me brownie points with my in laws who I invited the next day to join us for lunch. Not to mention the sweet surprises we found in our room, including a thoughtful card by General Manager Gino Tan! With its picturesque backdrop, we took countless photos by the pool to capture our memorable stay. After which we headed down to feast on an elaborate Chinese meal at JADE
I think it was very good in service and hotel's quality. Room service and Infinity pool was very good and location of hotel was also very good. And i'd like to thanks to the all the staffs in working in the hotel because of their hospitality and kindness.
From checking in to checking out! Every single staff hospitality are at their top notch! I celebrated my motherâ€™s and my sisterâ€™s birthday wonderfully! I will definitely come back again. The Fullerton Hotel is one of the most classic places I have ever stayed in Singapore. I can't wait to do another staycation soon!
Sharon & the team were exactly what we were looking for when we started to plan our wedding. They were super patient with all our questions during the planning process and during the days just prior to our wedding. We honestly couldnâ€™t have asked for a better team of professionals to make our day the most amazing day ever. Sharon and Darrell were and are so sweet, down to earth and personable! We had such a great experience with Sharon! They were attentive, easy to work with and professional. They provided anything and everything we needed although we chose to keep it simple. They handled my family and friends perfectly and gave my husband everything he asked. When it came down to the photos we had a blast! We recommend them highly! Big shout out once again to the operations
Stayed for 4 nights at the Park Royal Hotel and we were most impressed with the service provided by the staff and the quality of food on offer, nothing was too much trouble, even bringing an ice bucket to my room for me after my knee started giving me trouble. Plenty of choice of food for breakfast too. Rooms and hotel in general, spotlessly clean. Good location for Esplanade MRT Station and nearby shopping and food outlets, also very handy for open top bus tours and easy walks to the nearby tourist attractions. There's even a shopping centre which has a variety of retail outlets and food outlets directly beneath the Park Royal, accessible via stairs from level 4 in the hotel. Would definitely stay at the Park Royal next time we're in Singapore.
Asfar the lobby manager and Megat the Bell desk was very hospitable. My mom felt at home when they spoke Malay with her since sheâ€™s of Peranakan descent. The staff overall has been amazing and cheerful, always ready to help. Iâ€™d equate the feel at this location to a Four Seasons hotel in the USA.
