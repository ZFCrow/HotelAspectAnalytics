"A superb, iconic hotel that is centrally located. From check in to check out our experience was seamless. The staff were professional and helpful. The room, though slightly on the small side (but it is Singapore) was at the high standard we expected. The lobby and interior areas are impressive. The location is perfect, right by Marina Bay and close to public transportation. We booked a special deal that included dining credit, which we were able to use at the nearby Lantern restaurant (part of the Fullerton Bay Hotel). Of course this isn't one of the most economical hotels to stay at in Singapore, but if you're only in the city for a day or two and want that bit of luxury and convenience, it's a great choice. I can't think of anything to complain about.",,,,,,,
"This has to rate as one of the best hotels we have stayed in around the world! Was everything we expected in a 5* hotel and more with an impressive location and view of the Marina bay in Singapore right next to the Merlion Park. Lots of history in this colonial building so take the time to explore it. Room was large and very comfortable with everything you could need for an extended stay. Bed and linen top rate and we found it so comfortable we wanted to sleep in but needed to explore. Hotel location means you can walk anywhere, but for longer trips metro station within just 5 minutes. Staff very helpful giving lots of advice on where to go and what to see. Restaurant large and well appointed serving delicious buffet breakfast and lunch, didn't try the dinner. As the hotel is", I really like this hotel.,,,,,,
