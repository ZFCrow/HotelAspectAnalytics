Taxis are reasonably priced and all metered you don't need to tip anywhere in Singapore.
The breakfast is very everage and seems to be too expensive
affordable menu in foyer, close to shopping and restaurants
My sis and me first time here. Really worth for money, highly recommended & will definitely come back again. The staff here are very nice and warm too. Looking forward to my next visit here perhaps bring more people.
It was a pleasant stay with our kids but nothing very memorable. The kids love the bed and bath tub, the tv channels and the breakfast spread like any other hotels. There isn't much activities for kids but this isn't a family friendly hotel to begin with. But our request for a small cake to celebrate their belated birthday wasn't attended to, even after asking about it twice. We learnt from friends that kids usually receive a mini Fullerton Bear during check-in and requested for 1 during check out but was turned down by being ignored by the concierge. It would have been a nice stay for couples but not for family. Probably won't come again.
Visited here 3 yrs ago. Now, price goes up a lot the same as other hotels in Singapore. Anyway, I still feel it is worth money and the best in this price range. Room is small but very well-designed. They are partnered with Metis amenity brand, love it. I didnâ€™t have breakfast this time as it is pricey to add up, but remember it was very nice back then. Downstair has a bar as well, cannot comment, but 10 steps walking away there are local Thai restaurant and Indian restaurant (24hrs). Bencoolen is easy to travel to anywhere, but quiet and not crowded. If you like running, Fort Canning is open 24hrs, 5 mins running to, and a nice place to run up/downhill.
180.00 a night for very small room and another 80 if u want to check in early.... That half the cost of a room to check in 5 hrs early Atleast the ac works well but don't think it's worth the price See pictures attached also will be doing a video on it
Excellent location. Very small rooms and not worth for the money. WiFi also an issue. Facilities were limited. Not even a place to hang your clothes. I had a Great King room and hence the desk for working was good. Wash basin outlet pipe was also clogging.
My wife and I spent three days at The Fullerton Singapore. By far, it is the best hotel we have ever experienced. Above all, service from staff was superior in friendliness and accommodation in every way. It is in an older building, but is totally modernized. Our room was spacious, with luxurious amenities. Their breakfast buffet was fabulous, in variety and quality, as was their special seafood buffet nights. Location is excellent. For a top notch hotel, rates were more affordable for what is offered. We highly recommend it.
