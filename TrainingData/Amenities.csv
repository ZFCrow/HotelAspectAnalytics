very happy with the gym and pool usage.
Great clean amenities(gym, pool)
Amenities was good. I had breakfast, lunch and dinner in the restaurant. Nothing fancy but variety was good. The only dish I truly loved was the generous durian pengat. I ordered the fried rice via room service. The fried rice was good and the portion was generous. However for the price they charged, a glass of water was not included.
Great experience: exquisite service, great food, great location, very nice rooms, beautiful swimming pool. One of the oldest buildings of Singapore, the old post office. We would love to come back! We would recommend it to everyone (and the members club as well) Special thanks to Siri and Krish.
I have stayed Carlton City Hotel more than 1 months. The hotel has very good infrastructrue including nice room, swimming pool, gym etc and convenient transportation.
This hotel is a lovely and quality hotel, We had a club room with access to the club lounge. I know it costs a bit more for the lounge access but in my opinion it was worth it. Club access gives you breakfast and a cocktails for 2 hours in the evening all was fantastic and brilliant. Thank you Nicholas the lounge manger for the warm hospitality, each and every time!! Access to the MRT is quick and easy but remember to pay for your tourist ticket with cash. We couldn't use a credit card. The hotel was clean, friendly and always there to help. Greatest thank you again to Nicholas!!
Best pillows I've slept on in hotels! Usually ill the first night to familiarise myself with the pillows and bedding. In this case, I passed out, it was that comfy! The room also has the most intuitive lighting system, ambient yet bright enough for everything you need to do from work to play.
Fantastic location, great staff and room. The view from level 65 is outstanding! Stayed for 2 days in a club room on level 60 with views across to Marina Bay. Very comfortable room. The bathroom is a little small but that is the only drawback. Lovely pool area with lounges and cabanas. The door staff are some of the best I have ever experienced. It was the little touches that made it a great stay.
Wonderful location with plenty of F&B choices both in hotel and Raffles City Mall. Pool at level 8 is perfect for a swim and sun. Renovated rooms are clean and layout is ok. Coffee machine in pantry is a plus factor instead of the usual instant coffee bag. View from this hotel is always a reason why guest are repeating to come for stay.
