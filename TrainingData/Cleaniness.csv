Stayed for 2 nights, room nice but chair had a musty smell
The room had stains all over and smell of mold and fungus. The paint falling apart and seepage marks in the corner. The defecating area stinks as the flush doesn’t work well –The air-condition makes sounds synchronizing well with the construction noise outside. 
I was sorely disappointed as I am one who stresses cleanliness quite abit. It is currently my 2nd day here, and upon check-in, my toilet floor was dirty. There was hair that was cut left there, but I was too tired to complain. So, today after going out the whole day and coming back, guess what? The hair(quite a lot mind you, it seems someone was trimming hair here) was still on the toilet floor!!! Not only that, the cups were not washed, and it just felt like they replaced items and made the bed only. I am left speechless actually on the poor cleaning service.
The heritage room was rather spacious and the bathroom design was grand and big. The room however offered zero view, completely blocked by concrete walls and the small balcony was rather dirty. Still enjoyed the room interior. Bright, new and comfortable.
The beds and blankets were very soft and cozy. It was also very clean. And when i had breakfast there, the food was delicious! The hotel cleanliness is a 10/10. It also smells really nice there so I hope to have a stay there again soonâ˜ºï¸
Unfortunately this Hotel did come into the years. Our first Room had a bad humid smell. Later in the evening we discovered a wet spot at the ceiling where water was coming in. We changed room. Is looks all pretty old and used. I would not recommend to choose that Hotel specially if you are on a business trip. Nearby is the arabic quarter, which gives you access to some bars. There is also a mosque, which you can hear in the morning if your floor is not high enough. Breakfast was good enough. Checkout took pretty long. Personnel needs to be trained better.
Just got to the room and ir smells a lot like cigarette, the room is kind of dirty and there is cigarette ashes in the table. Disappointing thats the last thing i expected to find coming from the airport. Although they reacted quite quickly, thats a good thing.
No such good experience you may expected when you are in the bad day. Bad day can be defined as choosing a wrong hotel. This was the one. Lobby was smelt bad. Rooms was smell mold. Attitude is zero. If you have a change to get other hotel, better avoid it.
1) The moment we checked in, opened the bathroom door, and we were greeted with sewage smell.... 2) the mini fridge is very dirty... Yellow liquid... Not sure what's that. But pretty sure the hotel maid did not even bother to check and clean the mini fridge... 3) toothbrush bristle is super hard. Not sure if they are meant for humans or horses o.O 4) both bedside lamps has different level of dimness even if it was switched to the lowest brightness -.- ended up having to switch off one of it... 5) although we are locals, but we thought that the plugs in the rooms need some upgrading. Many hotels already have international ready plugs. But M Social SG only have local 3 pin wall plug. Pretty outdated... Should probably upgrade. Despite the disappointments, counter staff on
