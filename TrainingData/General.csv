We had a 4 night stay at the hotel and were generally impressed.
Overall, I really like this hotel.
I loved the location of the hotel.
We stayed at the wonderful Crest Suite Room number 6458 with an amazing view! The room is spacious, clean, comfortable, with great amenities and powerful hair dryer! The club lounge is amazing huge! I enjoyed the breakfast and the evening cocktail at the lounge with the very attentive and helpful staff. Eddy and Zai made the stay experience must better too, we are happy to meet them during our stay! Overall we recommend to stay at this hotel, great location, affordable room rate, clean and comfortable!
Top notch in every way. Raffles wasn't available when we booked, and we were totally happy with Fullerton. Waterfront setting is unbeatable rooms are large and perfectly kept Straits Club for breakfast and cocktails is comp, Every staff person we contacted was kind, conversant and helpful. Not inexpensive, but clearly worth it
The crew and staff are very accomodating. Nice and super friendly. Assistance is 100% excellent. Service friendly. The food is ok as well. We enjoyed our time dining. Excellent job performance. Good deal and worth the money.
There are many great hotels in the world - some even claim to be the best. But I firmly believe for a 5 star hotel - it doesnâ€™t get any better than The Fullerton. From arrival to departure - the experience is amazing. This was our 4th stay and it never disappoints and I actually believe it keeps getting better and better. The rooms are amazing (even the entry level premier courtyard rooms) the pool is a place of relaxation. Sall the pool attendant was great - as were the guest service staff who facilitated a late check out and left us a bottle of champagne in our room for being a returning guests (my partner also shares his surname with the hotel so is always treated like a king!) The location is top notch - walking distance to everything. Food, shops and major attractions.
My family and I stayed at this lovely hotel mid March and I would highly recommend it. The JW doesn't disappoint in it's cleanliness, service, food and staff. This hotel is very centrally located and a short 2 minute walk to the MRT. The Beach Road Kitchen offered a phenomenal breakfast with many choices. We were welcomed every morning with a bright smile from Lim Pei and they remembered our drink orders.. Chef Charles and his staff (including Gaba) treated us like royalty and was prepared to make each meal delightful. Breakfast became a smorgasbord of flavors and dishes. The Club Lounge had excellent snacks (drinks) and Lionel did his best to accommodate our needs. The gym is on the 18th floor with great views and always stocked with water and cold towels. The front desk staff
Excellent service, rooms very clean our room chamber maid Suna has been highly diligent maintaining the room very clean and very helpful in every respect. And the staff at the breakfast room and the club lounge very friendly and helpful. In general all staff very friendly and helpful, we enjoyed our stay very much
We stayed for 3 nights in a club lounge room on our way to New Zealand. The service and hospitality were outstanding in every aspect . Beautiful breakfast, afternoon tea and evening canapÃ©s and drinks. Special mention for Dorothy ðŸ¥° and her colleagues who went above and beyond to ensure guest satisfaction. We cannot wait to return in December. Thank you ðŸ˜Š
