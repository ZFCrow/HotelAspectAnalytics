"I live in New York City and have traveled to over 50 countries. But the kindness exhibited by Raymond, Siti and the staff at Amara really blew me away. After traveling for 24 hours to get to Singapore, they were incredibly kind and helpful and helped me settle in. The quality of the hotel and the room were outstanding. I’d gladly come back to experience this level of service again.",0.6000000009579318,1,1

"I’m really unsure how this hotel has so many good reviews. The pros were that the hotel was close to Chinatown, lots of restaurants and eateries, transport, a supermarket. The cons were the air conditioning was super loud, keeping me awake half the night. The room had a stale, musty smell overlaid with a chemical cleaning smell. A couple of the electrical outlets only worked intermittently. I thought it was my adapter but when we moved on to other hotels they worked perfectly fine. One pillow felt crumpled into bits like it’d been around long past any use by date. One of the lifts had tape hastily placed over the lift button. But worst of all, on our last night we had a smoke smell in our room. I rang the front desk (twice) thinking they would initiate an investigation into",-0.13125000125728548,0,2

"It’s just so old and tired now. Dangerous plugs, chipped furniture, no USB, noisy air con and drains and way overpriced for what you get. The pool is nice and the breakfast is good. I will say, we booked two rooms and a few days before, I contacted the hotel to ask them to remove one night stay on one of the rooms and they refused. No explanation, no customer service - just all about the money. Soulless, like the hotel. It’s 2023, I think peoples expectations are higher in service and experience for what the Amara offers. It feels like it might have been good 20 years ago.",-0.11363636058839885,0,2

"Nice staff even though issues at check in with a confusion regarding bag storage. Hotel seems generally very tired, this was probably the place to be 15-20years ago but now needs a full facelift. We were looking forward 1 night stay here on our return to Europe, it was booked specially because of the pool area and us wanting a relaxing time before a near 14h flight. However there are 3 large building sites surrounding the hotel with non stop drilling during daytime making the tranquil idea of pool a no go. Other guests look like they have found their own solution with either earplugs, AirPods, or personal speakers to try and blast out the building noise. I appreciate this is not the hotels fault however would’ve been handy to know before hand. Maybe I would return in 1-2years",0.0,0,2
"Stayed in the apartment-style room; lots of space, nice bathrooms and comfortable beds. The amenities and complimentary services provided were thoughtful and great. The location of the hotel is amazing as you are essentially at the centre of all tourist attractions and you can easily take an MRT to any location as the stations for 2 different lines are within a 5 minute walk. Additionally, there’s a mall attached to the hotel, local markets on the opposite side as well as two 7-elevens. Highly recommend this hotel when in Singapore.",0.5217391304347826,1,1
"This is not a 4 star standard hotel, more like a 3 star maximum. Firstly, our check in was great, Leslie was lovely & couldn’t be more helpful. We were upgraded from a deluxe to a premier room. Fantastic we thought! This was very short lived. The hallway and room had a terrible smell of damp, so much so we had to leave our room. Reception upgraded us once more with no question, to a suite. This hallway/ room seemed ok for the first day. The hotel is tired and dirty. The carpets are not cleaned/ hoovered around the perimeter, thick dust and dirt is visible everywhere. Wallpaper is taped up and dirty marks all over. Our bathroom had splatters on the bath which I do not want to know about (see photo) this was never cleaned. The second day, the hall started smelling of damp, not",-0.22857143144522393,0,0

"The service staff was extremely friendly, and the rooms were clean. The hotel is conveniently located just 5 to 10 minutes away from two nearby MRT stations, Tanjong Pagar and Maxwell, making transportation very convenient. Additionally, there is a supermarket just across the main entrance of the hotel, so you don't have to wander around if you forget to bring any daily necessities. Overall, I am satisfied with the service of this hotel, and I would definitely come back if I have the opportunity to visit Singapore again.",0.443750012665987,1,1
If there was a score less than 1 I would definitely rate it a zero. Mould in hallways and showers and bath also in bedroom and living area. Staff stealing money from room and management covering for them in a manner. Be warned when you see a safe in room as big as the one you have here. Also food for breakfast was cold and tasteless. Been to Singapore every year for 30 years. Not good now.,-0.23529411677051992,0,0

Prior to our arrival and long after we left the hotel the staff were incredibly accommodating and diligent and catered to our ever need.

The hotel staff was very responsive to our situation and went above and beyond what I've ever experienced: Oonah who was a manager, Keith, and especially Bernard. Any maintenance needs were tended promptly. Our room was comfortable and quiet. We felt the Amara was good value for dollar, and we discovered what a great location it was so we kept extending our stay. It has a lovely lap pool, a generous breakfast buffet, and the restaurant had exceptional Satay and Chicken and Rice. The fresh pressed green apple juice was a treat.

The older guy working on the egg counter was my favourite person in the hotel, so friendly, on the ball and very professional when some Asian men were a bit rude to him. He couldn't do enough for us.

No explanation about breakfast location/inclusions or wifi details etc. that usually will be mentioned upon check in. I wanted to surprise my partner at midnight by asking if they could help to send up a cake (which I was willing to purchase myself), but was told that room service closes at 9:30pm.

Breakfast is nothing great but good enough for a quick one in the morn before heading out. Location of the mall is the only good point about this hotel. It is just next to 100am mall. Eateries are everywhere - including opposite where Tanjong Pagar plaza is. If you walk further down past Carlton City hotel, there are tons of Korean and Japanese eateries.

Cracked tiles, scuffed wood, stains. Absolutely terrible TV. Hard bed with very noisy, minimally effective air conditioning leads to hot and uncomfortable nights and poor sleep. Not what you need when on a long trip. Beds are of course very subjective but this was like lying on bricks. I was able to get a mattress topper which did help a little but left with a sore back and neck every day. Breakfast is ok but you’d be better off going and exploring somewhere else if you aren’t in a hurry. Wouldn’t stay again unless I had no choice.

"I spent five nights here with my elderly mum (we are Singaporean, but have lived away for decades) and chose the hotel primarily for its location and alleged comforts for an older lady doing some significant travel. First, the pros. - The staff are helpful and kind. - The location is unbeatable though Tanjong Pagar has changed over the years and can be quite hectic on week nights in particular (it seems to have become another CBD with a lot of office workers) so don't expect a serene and relaxing stay. - Great access to food and other amenities (laundrette, supermarkets, banking etc) if you are staying here a while. There is absolutely no need for a hotel breakfast (unless you fancy it) as there are plenty of options - quite literally across the street. Some fantastic",0.1666666688742461,2,2

"Where to start? We encountered many issues during our week long stay at the Amara Singapore. The location of the hotel was convenient - close to the subway station, supermarkets, several local food centres and lots of restaurants and pubs within walking distance. However, the hotel was a genuine let down. On arrival, there was no porter to helped us with our luggage so we had to struggle with the heavy glass door to bring our luggage into the lobby. We arrived at the hotel at 3 pm, and there was a long queue for checkin. It took more than 45 minutes to finally be checked in, despite the fact that we had expected a more express checkin experience as warranted for a Club room.

"Our company flew from Australia to hold a three day event in Singapore. Amara Hotel impressed us with such a polished entrance and attended staff to start our trip.

"With very decent rates, the Amara is an enticing deal for a short getaway. The pool as usual is a cool spot to chill, and quiet enough for a refreshing dip. Included in the room rate was breakfast, and on Sunday they had a delicious nasi lemak where you could help yourself to warm spicy otak and fried chicken wings.

The hotel is central located literally next to everything , with a mall right next to the hotel , a supermarket in front , and two hawker centers in the 5 Min radius .

"There are better choices in the same area and price range, so stay elsewhere. The good points, the staff are polite and attentive to guests needs. They have a great pool well landscaped and long and straight great for lap swimmers. Beyond these two highlights there is not much more to recommend this property. This is an older property with all the usual scratches and bumps that are not really an issue. However that does not excuse poor standards in the management and running of the hotel. The not so good points. The bathroom in my room had mould around just about every tile, which tells you management either doesn’t inspect the rooms or does not notice this issue.

Had to fight at the desk to get the bill waived. - low hygiene. Super dusty room. - mould in the bathroom. See pictures. - staff: some nice, some horrible. Especially the short-hair lady at the checkin desk. - weak lighting in the room - tried to use the phone in the bathroom. It almost fell from the wall (see picture). - make up room: they dont do it. Asked the staff 3 days after checkin if they make up room daily, was told “not necessarily”. Had to ask 5 different people until it was finally done.

She explained about the room type we booked and thoughtful to remind us it doesn’t include a bath tub (premier executive) - which I am truly happy about to try out the new room! She tried to expedite the check-in and made small talks that made us laugh all together. Room was clean and looking fresh with all new appliances and furnishings. Our room was at level 6, which overlooks the gym and walkway to the pool - but no complaints on that! Bathroom was spacious and even had heated bidet seat on the toilet. Mirrors all around",0.22903225691087783,1,1
"Let's just stay objective. Pro: 1) Location. Spoilt for choice when it comes to food but I would not recommend eating in-house. Cheaper and better options are just across the road (many economy rice!) and if you want to pamper yourself a little, just hit the adjoining mall. 2) Bed: This is very subjective but I do find the bed to be firm and supportive. Not a lot of places get this right. Con: 1) Wifi: Unsecured and though reception said it was and they would prompt login upon first connection, we never got it. Also, the speed is just atrocious. Takes 4-5s to load an image from facebook, so you can imagine how that would throttle your entire surfing experience. 2) Front desk: As mentioned by another reviewer, you get decent (not outstanding) service while checking in.",0.025000001303851604,0,2

"I stayed at the Amara Singapore on my own for 16 days en route to Hong Kong. The room was spacious and well-lit, the amenities were enjoyable, and the food was great. It's also conveniently located in a bustling district just a couple minutes' walk from Chinatown. But what really stood out were the PEOPLE. They went above and beyond mere professionalism to make me feel at home during my stay. Feng Ting's friendliness was so welcome during check-in when I arrived exhausted and jetlagged from 18+ hours of travel and was barely able to string a sentence together.

Initial check-in experince was bad due to poor internal comms by hotel staff (requests made thru sales staff was not communicated to check in staff); and very late availability of rooms. Late check-out was subsequently offered, in view of the late availability of room. Rooms were generally ok. Clean and good size. But the TV and bar fridge could do with a refresh.

Afternoon tea was disappointing. Evening canapés was terrible. We only stayed for 30 minutes as my wife started not feeling well. Back in the room, she felt nauseous and had diarrhoea.

We were told that our rooms were not ready and would not be sure when it will be ready, the front desk tried to ease our unhappiness by upgrading us to a club room. However it was even worse, the 18th floor club level, walls were clouded with mound, the room smell like wet laundry and the bathrooms have stain on the bowls. That was the ultimate patience I could give, I request for the rooms that we have booked and paid, we don’t need an upgrade and told the lady I will not hesitate to make a formal",-0.2523809600444067,0,0

Long queue is one thing,we been waiting around for close to 2 hrs and still haven't got our room keys..with our luggage hanging ard... But it's ingenious they open at level 3 for the registration, cos not only it doesn't flood the level 1 lobby, it conceals the frustration of level 3 guests. They even screen cartoon and open a function room but the fact they haven't got our rooms ready is the ultimate problem.

"My stay with my family in Amara Hotel has been memorable. We booked a staycation as our overseas holiday was disrupted by the Covid-19 issue. So this staycation was meant to replace the holiday and spend time with family. Upon checking in, we were pleasantly surprised with an upgrade to a suite, thank you Amara Hotel and team for your kind generosity. My family used the swimming pool and enjoyed our time together. Last but not least, I would like to highlight hotel staff, Raymond for his exceptional service and hospitality to my family. Raymond provided food recommendations and kind advice on travelling around Amara hotel. His personalised service stands out as 6 stars for a 5 star hotel. Thank you Amara hotel, team and Raymond.

My girlfriend and I stayed at this hotel for 3 nights. The overall experience was ok but nothing exceptional. Liked · The location is really good. It’s right in the business district and a few minutes walk from the underground station Tanjong Pagar. Staff are friendly and the hotel is very very spacious both the rooms & the common areas. Breakfast is well organized with quite a lot of choice. Disliked · The premises are quite old and the rooms in general need to be refurbished.

The hotel had sent a repairman up to look at the unit (in the ceiling) and the repairman had told me that the controller was indeed spoilt and that there was no way i could tune the air temperature myself. However, he had tuned the temperature in the air con system directly and the cold air should come through soon. On the second day, still no change to the air con; had requested to change rooms.

I had another amazing stay at the AMARA Singapore. I was upgraded to a suite with a view of the sea between the buildings. Amazing! The bed and pillows are so comfortable - I always sleep so well there. The location is great - a grocery store below with lots of food choices in the mall next door (that is connected). Also food stalls across the streets. As always the service was great. Before my visit I had some shopping sent in advance and Raymond was so helpful in collecting them for me and sending them to my room. I had a late flight so Raymond arranged for me to have access to the pool so I could relax and then shower before leaving for the airport.

I hope the hotel appreciates just how good these two are and rewards them appropriately. We had breakfast in the club lounge most mornings as the breakfast room for all the other guests on the ground floor was very busy and noisy.

There have been a few changes from the last stay, and to the most I would say they are an improvement. We ate in three of the inhouse restaurants and found the service, pricing and quality of the food first-class. The only disappointment was that the open bar area has been replaced with an enclosed cocktail bar. I found this a little odd as the old bar area had live music and was a great place to unwind after a day out in the heat.

It has generous amounts of jumbo prawns and Chinese sausage, which I washed down with a wonderful teh tarik. I live in Singapore but I will probably take guests here to try out local delicacies.

The hairdryer needs to be replaced/repaired bec the wire is starting to get exposed (see photos) 2.

"My sis just got married last Sunday in Amara Hotel. I was tasked to be her wedding manager to coordinate the flow of the dinner programmes. As this was my first experience planning a wedding dinner, I was afraid that things does not turn out smoothly.

"The hotel is near MRT at Tanjong Pagar and an easy walk to China Town. Nice hotel with excellent rooms, friendly staff and service. We always stay in a Club room and this time were disappointed with the level of food and choice which has drastically dropped away this time.

There is a short 10 minute walk to the nearest metro station but it is a picturesque walk through parks and heritage buildings.

Upon arrival at 4pm we were told that our room was still not ready. Once we eventually managed to check in, the room we were provided with was on the smoking floor and was extremely dirty. After bringing this to the attention of the duty manager, we were then moved into another room where we were provided with a small camp bed for my two sons to share (after originally booking a two bedroom apartment) We checked out the next day and would advise all travellers to avoid this hotel if you want to be comfortable during your stay in Singapore.",-0.11052631782857995,0,2

"I was excited to stay for the first time at the Amara hotel. Now I’m excited to never stay here again. I like to try different mid-range hotels when I’m in Singapore. Usually I can get a great room for 100-150 USD downtown. I decided to go closer to the 200 USD range for a night and try the Amara hotel. The lobby was fantastic. The check in and staff was fantastic. Check out and getting a taxi booked was great. Everything looked 4-star (Agoda lists it as 5-star). Upon entering the room, the room and bathroom was big. Then my stay made a left turn down mediocre lane. Here are the reasons why the Amara is a 100 USD charging 200 USD a night. 1. The wifi is my biggest complaint.

This hotel is supposed to be a 4-star property but I was shocked when their bath towel has 2 holes. The towel was really old yet still in use. It is really unbecoming to provide guests with towels with holes. This shows that there is no quality control in this hotel. I tried to alert them (not complain) to this matter by emailing them a photo of the torn towel after my stay but they have not bothered to thank me for my alert or reply to my email. I emailed them twice but not a word from them. I have never encountered arrogance of such level from a hotel. Forget about giving any feedback to this hotel.
